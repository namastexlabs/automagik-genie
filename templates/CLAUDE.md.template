## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Detection

**The {{PROJECT_NAME}}-genie-analyzer agent will automatically detect:**
- Programming languages (Go, Rust, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
- Frameworks (React, Vue, Django, FastAPI, Spring Boot, Gin, etc.)
- Build systems (Maven, Gradle, Cargo, Go modules, npm/yarn, etc.)
- Testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, Go test, Cargo test, etc.)
- Quality tools (ESLint, Ruff, rustfmt, gofmt, etc.)

**No manual configuration needed** - the analyzer handles tech stack adaptation!

## üéØ Development Workflow

### First Steps
1. **Analyze your codebase**: `/wish "analyze this codebase"`
2. **Get tech-stack-specific recommendations**: Analyzer will provide language/framework-specific guidance
3. **Start development**: Use detected patterns and tools for optimal development experience

### Available Hooks (Working Examples!)
- **TDD Guard**: Real TDD workflow enforcement with multi-language support
- **Quality Automation**: Pre-commit validation with auto-detected tech stack tools
- **Ready to Use**: Copy templates, make executable, customize for {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## üìö Getting Started

Run your first wish to let the analyzer understand your project:
```
/wish "analyze this codebase and provide development recommendations"
```

The analyzer will auto-detect your tech stack and provide customized guidance!

- `/wish "create API documentation"`

### Agent-Specific Spawning
The system will automatically choose the right agents, but you can be specific:
- Spawn {{PROJECT_NAME}}-genie-analyzer for codebase analysis
- Spawn {{PROJECT_NAME}}-genie-dev-coder for implementation
- Spawn {{PROJECT_NAME}}-genie-dev-fixer for debugging
- Spawn {{PROJECT_NAME}}-genie-clone for complex multi-task coordination

## üí° Development Tips

### Let the Analyzer Guide You
- Always start new projects with codebase analysis
- The analyzer will detect your tech stack and provide appropriate recommendations
- Other agents will use analyzer findings for tech-stack-specific assistance

### Optimal Agent Usage
