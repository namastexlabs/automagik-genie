# Genie - Research Preview Disclaimer

## Experimental Software Notice

**Genie is experimental software currently in research preview (Release Candidate stage).** This AI agent system is under active development and has not yet reached stable production release.

## What Genie Does

Genie is an autonomous AI agent orchestration framework that installs to your local machine with capabilities to:

- **Read and write files** in your workspace
- **Execute terminal commands** on your behalf
- **Perform git operations** including commits, pushes, and pull request creation
- **Run tests, builds, and CI/CD workflows**
- **Orchestrate development tasks** across multiple AI agents
- **Learn and adapt** through meta-learning capabilities

## User Responsibilities

By installing and using Genie, you acknowledge and accept the following:

### 1. Experimental Nature
- This software is **experimental** and under **active development**
- Features may change, break, or behave unexpectedly
- No stable releases exist yet (all releases are tagged `@latest` or `-rc.X`)
- Bugs, errors, and unexpected behaviors should be expected

### 2. Agent Actions & Oversight
- **You are responsible for reviewing all actions** performed by Genie agents
- Agents may make mistakes, produce incorrect code, or take unexpected actions
- Always verify changes before committing, pushing, or deploying
- Use version control (git) to track and revert unwanted changes
- Test thoroughly before production use

### 3. Data & Privacy Responsibility
- **You are responsible for understanding what data Genie processes**
- Configure LLM providers that comply with your organization's policies
- Use only LLM subscriptions approved for your use case (personal/professional)
- Be aware that data sent to LLM APIs leaves your local machine
- Consider using local/private LLMs for sensitive workspaces (OpenCoder executor available)

### 4. Security Considerations
- Genie has **full access to your workspace** where it's installed
- Agents can execute arbitrary commands with your user permissions
- Review agent configurations and prompts before execution
- Do not run Genie in environments with sensitive credentials or production systems without proper safeguards
- Use dedicated test/development environments for experimentation

## Data Privacy & Security

### What Stays Local
‚úì **All Genie code and orchestration** runs locally on your machine
‚úì **Your workspace files** never leave your computer (except via LLM API calls)
‚úì **Forge backend** runs locally (http://localhost:8887)
‚úì **MCP server** runs locally (http://localhost:8885)
‚úì **Session state, logs, and history** stored locally in `.genie/state/`

### What Leaves Your Machine
‚ö†Ô∏è **LLM API calls** - Code, prompts, and context sent to your configured LLM provider
‚ö†Ô∏è **Version checks** - npm registry queries to check for updates
‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional telemetry** (if enabled) - Anonymous usage statistics

### Privacy Recommendations
- **For personal projects**: Use any LLM provider you trust
- **For professional work**: Use LLM providers approved by your organization
- **For sensitive data**: Use local/private LLMs (e.g., OpenCoder executor with local models)
- **For compliance**: Configure Genie to use your organization's approved AI infrastructure
