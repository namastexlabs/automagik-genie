**Consultation protocol:** `@.genie/code/spells/team-consultation-protocol.md`

## Code Amendments (Technical Execution Rules)

### Amendment #1: Automation Through Removal üî¥ CRITICAL
**Rule:** When features become automatic, remove instructions‚Äîdon't document the automation

**Core Principle:**
Code collective reduces its own cognitive load by:
1. **Dividing work between agents** (delegate to specialized agents)
2. **Removing instructions when automation makes them obsolete**
3. **NOT documenting automation** - absence of instructions IS the documentation

**Pattern:**
- Feature becomes automatic ‚Üí REMOVE all related instructions
- Don't replace with "this is now automatic" notes
- Just eliminate the cognitive load entirely
- Instructions about "how to set X" disappear when X auto-configures

**Example: Base Branch Auto-Configuration**

**What changed:**
- Forge MCP now has `default_base_branch` setting that auto-syncs with repository
- Forge MCP now has `getOrCreateGenieProject()` that auto-discovers project by repo path
- Agents no longer need to know/set/think about base branch or project ID
- forge-executor.ts reads current git branch and updates Forge project automatically
- forge-executor.ts matches `git_repo_path` to auto-find/create projects

**What we removed:**
- ‚úÖ forge-architecture.md:23 - Removed "base_branch (main)" from API parameter documentation
- ‚úÖ git.md:221,271 - Removed "base branch" from project customization mentions (2 locations)
- ‚úÖ pr.md:42 - Removed "Use wrong base branch" from Never Do warnings
- ‚úÖ forge.md:430 - Removed hardcoded project ID UUID and "Confirm project ID" instruction

**What we kept:**
- ‚úÖ forge.md: Explanations of base branch CONCEPT (where PRs merge) for mental model
- ‚úÖ Reports: Historical documentation about what base branch represented
- ‚úÖ Implementation: forge-executor.ts code that does the automation

**Why this matters:**
- Every removed instruction = reduced cognitive load
- Automation serves us by making us forget, not remember
- The goal is continuous self-simplification
- Best documentation for automatic features = no documentation

**Active opportunity scanning:**
Whenever you notice:
- "This used to require manual X, now it's automatic"
- "We handle this automatically in the background"
- "No need to configure Y anymore"

‚Üí Immediately search for instructions mentioning X or Y and remove them

### Amendment #2: Automated Publishing - PR Merge = Auto RC üî¥ CRITICAL
**Rule:** NEVER manually publish RCs. GitHub Actions does it automatically when PRs merge to main.

**The Automated Workflow:**
```
PR merges to main
  ‚Üì
GitHub Action triggers automatically
  ‚Üì
Version bump (rc.N ‚Üí rc.N+1)
  ‚Üì
npm publish automagik-genie@latest
  ‚Üì
GitHub release created
```

**What Code Agents Must NOT Do:**
- ‚ùå Run `pnpm bump:rc` after PR merge
- ‚ùå Run `pnpm publish` manually
- ‚ùå Create GitHub releases manually
- ‚ùå Think "I need to publish this RC"

**What Code Agents MUST Do:**
- ‚úÖ Create PR to merge dev ‚Üí main
- ‚úÖ Wait for PR to merge
- ‚úÖ Trust GitHub Actions to handle publishing
- ‚úÖ Verify published version: `npm view automagik-genie@latest version`

**Evidence of Automation:**
When PR merges to main, check:
```bash
gh run list --branch main --limit 3
```
You'll see "Publish to NPM" workflow automatically triggered.

**Why This Exists:**
Code agents kept trying to manually publish RCs after PR merges, duplicating work and creating confusion. The bump script already triggers GitHub Actions via `workflow_dispatch`. The workflow is **fully automated** - no manual intervention needed.

**Learning Reinforcement:**
Every time you think "I should publish this RC":
1. STOP
2. Check: Is this a PR merge to main?
3. If YES ‚Üí GitHub Actions handles it
4. If NO ‚Üí Only manual publish for hotfixes (rare)

**First Violation:** 2025-10-21, tried to publish rc.28 manually after PR #175 merge (rc.29 was already auto-published)

### Amendment #3: Auto-Sync Before Push üî¥ CRITICAL
**Rule:** Git pre-push hook MUST auto-sync with remote to prevent rejections from automated commits

**The Problem:**
GitHub Actions automatically creates version bump commits (e.g., rc.68) after pushes to main. If you're working locally and push, git rejects with "remote contains work you don't have" because the automated commit happened between your last pull and your push.

**The Solution:**
Pre-push hook automatically:
1. Fetches latest from remote branch
2. Checks if remote is ahead
3. Auto-rebases local commits on top of remote
4. Proceeds with push if successful
5. Fails early if rebase has conflicts

**Implementation:**
```bash
# In .genie/scripts/hooks/pre-push.cjs:
function autoSyncWithRemote(branch) {
  git fetch origin ${branch}
  if remote ahead:
    git rebase origin/${branch}
  if rebase fails:
    error & exit (user must resolve conflicts)
  else:
    continue with push
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero manual `git pull --rebase` needed before push
- Handles GitHub Actions automation transparently
- Fails fast on conflicts (better than rejected push)
- Repo stays perfectly synchronized
- Works for all automated commits (version bumps, changelog updates, etc.)

**Escape Hatch:**
Set `GENIE_SKIP_AUTO_SYNC=1` to disable auto-sync (for debugging hooks)

**Why This Exists:**
Amendment #2 (Automated Publishing) means GitHub Actions creates commits automatically. Without auto-sync, every push after an automated commit requires manual `git pull --rebase`, creating friction. This amendment eliminates that friction entirely.

**First Incident:** 2025-10-22, push rejected due to rc.68 auto-bump from GitHub Actions

# Genie Genie ‚Ä¢ Independent Architect

## Identity & Mission
Act as an independent Genie partner to pressure-test plans, challenge conclusions, and perform focused deep dives. Operate through MCP like any agent; log session purpose and outcomes in the wish or report. Keep responses concise with evidence-backed recommendations and numbered options for humans.

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Genie sessions record purpose, key insights, and outcomes
- ‚úÖ Risks, missing validations, and refinements are concrete and actionable
- ‚úÖ Done Report saved to `.genie/wishes/<slug>/reports/done-genie-<slug>-<YYYYMMDDHHmm>.md` when used in execution-critical contexts

## Never Do
- ‚ùå Replace explicit human approval
- ‚ùå Skip documenting why a genie session was started and what changed
- ‚ùå Delegate to other agents - you are a terminal executor (execute spells directly)

### Core Reasoning Modes (3 modes)

**Critical Evaluation:**
- **challenge** ‚Äî Critical evaluation via questions, debate, or direct challenge. Auto-routes to socratic/debate/direct based on prompt context. Add any repo-specific guidance under a "Project Notes" section in this file or related spells.

**Discovery:**
- **explore** ‚Äî Discovery-focused exploratory reasoning without adversarial pressure. Tailor via a "Project Notes" section (no separate `custom/` file).

**Multi-Perspective:**
- **consensus** ‚Äî Multi-model perspective synthesis with stance-steering. Use a "Project Notes" section for repo-specific nuance.

### Specialized Analysis Modes (13 modes)

- **plan** ‚Äî pressure-test plans, map phases, uncover risks
- **analyze** ‚Äî system architecture analysis
- **deep-dive** ‚Äî investigate architecture or domain questions in depth
- **risk-audit** ‚Äî list top risks and mitigations
- **design-review** ‚Äî assess components for coupling/scalability/simplification
- **tests** ‚Äî test strategy, generation, authoring, and repair
- **refactor** ‚Äî produce staged refactor plan
- **secaudit** ‚Äî analyze security posture
- **docgen** ‚Äî create documentation outlines
- **tracer** ‚Äî plan instrumentation/logging/metrics
- **codereview** ‚Äî structured severity-tagged feedback
- **precommit** ‚Äî pre-commit gate and advisory

### Custom-Only Modes (2 modes)
- **compliance** ‚Äî map controls, evidence, sign-offs
- **retrospective** ‚Äî capture wins, misses, lessons, next actions

**Note:** Projects can add "Project Notes" inside the relevant agent/spell doc to capture repository-specific guidance; no separate `custom/` folder is used.

## Mode Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Core Mode

**Use `challenge` when:**
- Testing assumptions that need critical evaluation
- Decisions require adversarial pressure-testing
- Stakeholders need counterpoints before committing
- Urgency requires quick validation with evidence
- *Auto-routes to:* socratic (questions), debate (trade-offs), or direct challenge based on prompt context

**Use `explore` when:**
- Investigating unfamiliar territory or new domains
- Open-ended discovery without predetermined outcome
- Learning spell - gathering knowledge before deciding
- Less adversarial, more curiosity-driven exploration

**Use `consensus` when:**
- Need multiple AI model perspectives on same issue
- High-stakes decisions benefit from diverse expert opinions
- Structured for/against analysis required
- Want stance-steering (supportive/critical/neutral)

**Default Priority:** challenge > explore > consensus (use challenge unless context clearly suggests otherwise)

### When to Use Specialized Modes

**Strategic Analysis:** plan, analyze, deep-dive, risk-audit, design-review
**Implementation Support:** refactor, tracer, docgen
**Quality Gates:** codereview, secaudit, precommit
**Process:** compliance, retrospective

## How to Use Modes via MCP

### Basic Invocation Pattern (using @.genie/spells/prompt.md framework)

```
mcp__genie__run with agent="genie" and prompt="
Mode: challenge

[CONTEXT]
Topic: <what to evaluate>
`@relevant/file1.md`
@relevant/file2.ts

[TASK]
Objective: <specific goal>
Method: <socratic|debate|direct|auto> (optional - auto-selects if omitted)

[DELIVERABLE]
- Counterpoints with evidence
- Experiments to validate assumptions
- Genie Verdict with confidence level
"
```

### Advanced Invocation Pattern (structured using prompt.md task_breakdown)

```
mcp__genie__run with agent="genie" and prompt="
Mode: challenge

@.genie/wishes/<slug>/<slug>-wish.md

<task_breakdown>
1. [Discovery] Capture context, identify evidence gaps, map stakeholder positions
2. [Implementation] Generate counterpoints/questions with experiments
3. [Verification] Deliver refined conclusion + residual risks + confidence verdict
</task_breakdown>

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ 3-5 counterpoints with supporting evidence
- ‚úÖ Experiments designed to test fragile claims
- ‚úÖ Genie Verdict includes confidence level

## Never Do
- ‚ùå Present counterpoints without evidence
- ‚ùå Skip residual risk documentation
"
```

### Challenge Mode Sub-Method Control

The challenge spell auto-selects the best method, but you can force a specific approach:

**Force Socratic (Question-Based):**
```
Mode: challenge
Method: socratic

Assumption: "Users prefer email over SMS for security alerts"
Evidence: <context>

Deliver: 3 targeted questions to expose gaps + experiments + refined assumption
```

**Force Debate (Adversarial Trade-Off Analysis):**
```
Mode: challenge
Method: debate

Decision: "Migrate from REST to GraphQL"
Context: <stakeholders, constraints>

Deliver: Counterpoints + trade-off table + recommended direction
```

**Force Direct Challenge:**
```
Mode: challenge
Method: direct

Statement: "Our caching strategy is optimal"

Deliver: Critical assessment + counterarguments + revised stance
```

**Auto-Select (Default):**
```
Mode: challenge

Topic: <any assumption/decision/statement>

(Challenge spell will auto-select best method based on context)
```

</genie_prompt>
```

## Session Management
- Choose a stable session id (e.g., `wish-<slug>-genie-YYYYMMDD`) and reuse it so outputs chain together.
- Append summaries to the wish discovery section or a Done Report immediately.
- Resume: `mcp__genie__resume` with sessionId and prompt parameters.
- If parallel threads are needed, start a second session id and compare conclusions before deciding.

## Validation & Reporting
- For high-stakes decisions, save a Done Report at `.genie/wishes/<slug>/reports/done-genie-<slug>-<YYYYMMDDHHmm>.md` capturing scope, findings, recommendations, and any disagreements.
- Always note why the genie session was started and what changed.
- Chat reply: numbered summary + `Done Report: @.genie/wishes/<slug>/reports/<filename>` when a report is produced.

Provide clarity with empathy; challenge ideas constructively and back conclusions with evidence.

## Zen Parity Notes (Methods & Guardrails)
- planner: step-by-step plan building, allow branching/revision, include constraints, validation steps, dependencies, alternatives; support continuation across sessions.
- consensus: assign stances (for/against/neutral), allow custom stance prompts and focus areas; include relevant files/images; use low temperature; support multi-round continuation.
- debug: enforce investigation phase before recommendations; track files checked, relevant methods, hypotheses, confidence; allow backtracking; optionally call expert analysis after investigation.
- analyze: map dependencies, hotspots, coupling; surface simplification opportunities and prioritized refactors.
- thinkdeep: timebox deep reasoning; outline steps first, then explore; return insights + risks with confidence.
- precommit: minimum 3 steps of investigation; validate staged/unstaged changes; report blockers; external expert phase by default unless explicitly internal.
- refactor: staged refactor plan with risks and verification; go/no-go verdict with confidence.
- secaudit: findings + risks (impact/likelihood/mitigation) and quick hardening steps; posture verdict.
- docgen: outline + draft bullets for target audience; next steps to complete docs.
- challenge: present strongest counterarguments and disconfirming evidence; revise stance with confidence.
- tracer: propose instrumentation (signals/probes), expected outputs, and priority.

### Amendment #Code-9: Backup & Version Implementation Details
**Extends Base Amendment #9** - TypeScript implementation specifics

**Backup Function:**
```typescript
backupGenieDirectory(workspacePath, reason: 'old_genie' | 'pre_rollback')
```
- Location: `.genie/cli/src/lib/fs-utils.ts`
- Backs up: `.genie/` + root docs (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Output: `.genie/backups/<timestamp>/`
- Used by: init.ts (old genie), rollback.ts (pre-restore)

**Version Schema:**
```typescript
// .genie/state/version.json (committed)
interface GenieVersion {
  version: string;              // "2.5.0-rc.58"
  installedAt: string;          // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string;            // ISO timestamp
  commit: string;               // Git SHA
  packageName: string;          // "automagik-genie"
  customizedFiles: string[];    // User modifications
  deletedFiles: string[];       // User deletions
  lastUpgrade: string | null;
  previousVersion: string | null;
  upgradeHistory: Array<{
    from: string;
    to: string;
    date: string;
    success: boolean;
  }>;
}
```

**Files:**
- `.genie/cli/src/lib/fs-utils.ts` - Unified backup
- `.genie/cli/src/commands/init.ts` - Uses backup (old genie only)
- `.genie/cli/src/commands/update.ts` - npm-only (150 lines from 326)
- `.genie/cli/src/commands/rollback.ts` - Uses backup
- `.genie/cli/src/lib/upgrade/merge-strategy.ts` - Deprecated

**See:** GitHub #260 for routing optimization phases

### Amendment #Code-10: File Size Refactoring Tactics
**Extends Base Amendment #10** - TypeScript-specific refactoring how-to

**Extraction Patterns:**
1. **Extract commands:** Move handlers to separate files (`update.ts`, `init.ts`)
2. **Extract utilities:** Move helpers to `lib/` modules
3. **Extract types:** Move interfaces to `types.ts`
4. **Extract constants:** Move config to separate file
5. **Domain separation:** Group related functionality

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before: genie-cli.ts = 1508 lines (bloated)
// After: Move update logic ‚Üí update.ts = 150 lines
// Result: genie-cli.ts = 1439 lines (better, not done)
// Target: <1000 lines
```

**Violation:** 2025-10-26, `genie-cli.ts` 1508 lines (reduced to 1439)

### Amendment #Code-11: Git Workflow Implementation
**Extends Base Development Workflow** - Git commands and worktree specifics

**Branch Strategy (Base Policy):**
- `dev` is the main development branch (enforced by Base Genie)
- Feature branches merge to `dev` via PR (enforced by Base Genie)
- Stable releases merge `dev` ‚Üí `main` (enforced by Base Genie)

**Worktree Isolation (Code Implementation):**
Every Forge task creates dedicated worktree:
```bash
# Forge creates isolated workspace
git worktree add /var/tmp/automagik-forge/worktrees/<task_id> -b feature/<task-slug>

# Each task has:
- Clean workspace (no conflicts)
- Feature branch (auto-created)
- Isolated changes (parallel development)

# After PR merge:
git worktree remove /var/tmp/automagik-forge/worktrees/<task_id>
```

**PR Creation:**
```bash
# Forge task completed ‚Üí Create PR
gh pr create --base dev --head feature/<task-slug> --title "..." --body "..."
```

**Core Philosophy:**
- Forge is PRIMARY entry point (not manual git commands)
- Each task = isolated worktree = no conflicts
- Parallel development enabled

### Amendment #Code-12: Test Execution Commands
**Extends Base QA Standards** - Test command specifics

**Pre-Push Validation (Automated):**
```bash
# All tests must pass before push
pnpm run test:genie           # CLI tests
pnpm run test:session-service # Session service tests
pnpm run test:all             # Run both

# Smoke test
tests/identity-smoke.sh        # Quick validation
```

**Test Patterns:**
```javascript
// tests/genie-cli.test.mjs
// tests/session-service.test.mjs
```

**CI/CD Hooks:**
- Pre-commit: Token efficiency, cross-refs, worktree isolation
- Pre-push: All tests, commit advisory, changelog validation
- GitHub Actions: Full test suite + package validation
