# Orchestration Boundary Protocol
**Skill ID:** `orchestration-boundary-protocol`
**Category:** Core Discipline
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Created:** 2025-10-21
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`

## The Violation Pattern

**What happened:**
1. Base Genie created Forge task for bug #168
2. Base Genie started task attempt b51db539 (isolated worktree)
3. Base Genie THEN started implementing the fix in main workspace
4. **Result:** Duplicate work, boundary violation, confusion

**Why this is critical:**
- Forge executor is ALREADY working in isolated worktree
- Base Genie editing same files = conflict + duplication
- Violates core principle: Genie = orchestrator, NOT implementor

---

## The Rule

**Once Forge task attempt starts ‚Üí Base Genie STOPS touching implementation**

**Genie's role after delegation:**
- ‚úÖ Monitor progress (check Forge status)
- ‚úÖ Answer questions if Forge executor asks
- ‚úÖ Coordinate with other agents
- ‚úÖ Plan next steps
- ‚ùå Edit code files
- ‚ùå Implement fixes
- ‚ùå Duplicate Forge's work

---

## Enforcement Checklist

Before editing ANY implementation file, Base Genie must check:

1. **Is there an active Forge task attempt for this work?**
   - Check SESSION-STATE.md
   - Check `mcp__automagik_forge__list_task_attempts`
   - If YES ‚Üí STOP, let Forge handle it

2. **Am I the right agent for this work?**
   - Implementation ‚Üí Forge executor
   - Orchestration ‚Üí Base Genie
   - Learning ‚Üí Meta-learn protocol (this!)
   - Git operations ‚Üí Git agent

3. **Is this exploration or execution?**
   - Exploration (reading, analyzing) ‚Üí OK for Genie
   - Execution (editing, implementing) ‚Üí Delegate

---

## When Genie CAN Touch Code

**Genie MAY edit files when:**
- No Forge task exists for this work
- Work is pure orchestration (SESSION-STATE.md, MASTER-PLAN.md)
- Emergency hotfix (and no Forge available)
- Applying meta-learning (creating/updating .genie/skills/)

**Genie MUST NOT edit files when:**
- Forge task attempt is active
- Work is implementation (bug fixes, features)
- Another agent is responsible (Git agent for git files)

---

## The Correct Pattern

**User:** "Fix bug #168 (graceful shutdown)"

**Genie's workflow:**
1. ‚úÖ Create Forge task (if no task exists)
2. ‚úÖ Start task attempt (isolated worktree)
3. ‚úÖ **STOP** - Forge executor takes over
4. ‚úÖ Monitor progress (check Forge status)
5. ‚úÖ Review when complete
6. ‚úÖ Coordinate PR/merge if needed

**What Genie does NOT do:**
- ‚ùå Start implementing after creating task
- ‚ùå Edit files in main workspace
- ‚ùå Duplicate Forge's work

---

## Amendment #4 Candidate

**Proposed:** "Orchestration Boundary - Once Delegated, Never Duplicated"

**Rule:** Base Genie MUST NOT implement work after starting Forge task attempt

**Enforcement:**
- Checklist before every Edit/Write tool call
- SESSION-STATE.md tracking of active attempts
- Meta-learn protocol (this skill) for violations

**Status:** Documented, ready for AGENTS.md integration

---

## Evidence & History

**First Documented Violation:**
- Date: 2025-10-21 ~05:45 UTC
- Bug: #168 (graceful shutdown)
- Task attempt: b51db539
- Files affected: .genie/cli/src/genie-cli.ts
- Root cause: Unclear boundaries between orchestration vs execution

**Pattern recognized by:** Felipe (user feedback)

**Learning applied:** This skill file created

## Meta-Learning Application

**This skill itself demonstrates correct protocol:**
- Genie recognized violation
- Applied meta-learn protocol (not Forge task)
- Created skill file directly
- Updated AGENTS.md
- **Did NOT create unnecessary task for learning documentation**

**When to use meta-learn vs Forge:**
- Meta-learn: Document patterns, create skills, update framework
- Forge: Implement features, fix bugs, build systems

---

## Quick Reference

**Before editing implementation files, ask:**
1. Is Forge already handling this? ‚Üí Check SESSION-STATE.md
2. Am I the orchestrator or implementor? ‚Üí Orchestrator = don't implement
3. Is there a specialized agent for this? ‚Üí Delegate, don't do

**Remember:** Once delegated, never duplicated.
