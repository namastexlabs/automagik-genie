**File:** `.genie/reports/bug-66-session-disappears-investigation.md`
**Size:** 337 lines, 11KB
**Commit:** `c2ac9bca`

**Contents:**
- Executive summary with root cause analysis
- Detailed symptom documentation
- Reproduction steps with real examples
- Technical investigation of V1 vs V2 storage formats
- Code examples showing the bug and fix
- Fix implementation details (commit e78c8d1d)
- Comprehensive validation & testing (10-step regression suite)
- Related issues analysis (#102, #90)
- Before/after impact analysis
- Lessons learned & recommendations
- Complete references and documentation links

### 2. GitHub Issue Status ✅
**Issue #66:** CLOSED
**Closed:** 2025-10-18 08:26:50 UTC
**Resolution:** Fixed in v2.4.0-rc.9, validated in v2.4.0-rc.21

### 3. Resolution Summary
**Root Cause:** Session storage used agent names as keys (V1 format), causing new sessions to overwrite previous ones of the same agent type
**Fix:** Migrated to V2 storage format with sessionId-based keying
**Impact:** CRITICAL bug blocking multi-agent workflows - fully resolved

## What Was Accomplished

1. ✅ **Retrieved complete bug history** from GitHub issue #66
2. ✅ **Located existing investigation report** from commit 2b37f6ee
3. ✅ **Copied comprehensive documentation** to current worktree
4. ✅ **Verified issue closure** on GitHub (closed 2025-10-18)
5. ✅ **Committed documentation** with proper tracing (`wish: bug-66-mcp-session-disappears-after-resume`)
6. ✅ **Created completion summary** for archival purposes

---

## Key Findings

### The Bug
- Sessions appeared active in `list_sessions` but returned "No run found" on `view`/`resume`
- Sessions became inaccessible after ~45 minutes of runtime
- Complete context loss prevented work recovery
- Blocked multi-agent workflows and session coordination

### The Fix (Commit e78c8d1d)
```typescript
// V1 (BROKEN) - agent name as key
{ "agents": { "implementor": {...} } }

// V2 (FIXED) - sessionId as key
{ "sessions": { "abc-123": {...}, "def-456": {...} } }
```

### Validation
- 10-step regression test suite created
- Tested in v2.4.0-rc.9, validated in rc.21
- No regressions detected
- Related bugs #102 and #90 also resolved
