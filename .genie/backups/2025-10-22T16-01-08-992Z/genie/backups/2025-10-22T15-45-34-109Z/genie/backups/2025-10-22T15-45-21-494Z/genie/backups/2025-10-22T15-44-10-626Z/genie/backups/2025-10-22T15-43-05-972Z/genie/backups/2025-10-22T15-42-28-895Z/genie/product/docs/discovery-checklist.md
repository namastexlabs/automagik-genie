**Project:** automagik-genie â†” Forge Backend
**Purpose:** Validation tasks for unmapped endpoints before implementation
**Status:** Ready for execution

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This checklist defines all **Discovery investigations** required before implementing Categories 6-15 endpoints. Each item includes:
- **Objective:** What we need to learn
- **Questions:** Specific validation points
- **Deliverable:** Expected output
- **Estimated Time:** Investigation duration
- **Priority:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- **Dependencies:** What else needs to be done first

## HIGH PRIORITY (Blocks Core Features)

### Discovery #1: Approvals Endpoint Validation
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ HIGH
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Blocking:** Group A implementation (PR creation workflow)

**Objective:**
Validate Forge's `createApprovalRequest/get/respond` endpoints match our final approval gate use case.

**Questions:**
1. What is the exact payload structure for `createApprovalRequest()`?
2. Does it support blocking behavior (wait for response)?
3. Can we attach context (diffs, test results, branch status)?
4. How are approval responses communicated (polling? SSE?)?
5. What happens if approval times out?
6. Can we configure approval policies (required for PR/merge)?

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Read Forge API documentation for approval endpoints
2. Test `createApprovalRequest()` with sample data
3. Test `respondToApprovalRequest()` (approve/deny)
4. Verify SSE event emitted on approval request/response
5. Identify gaps between Forge endpoint and our needs

**Deliverable:**
- `.genie/discovery/approvals-validation.md`
  - Endpoint documentation (request/response schemas)
  - Behavior validation (blocking, timeout, policies)
  - Gap analysis (what Forge doesn't support)
  - Recommendation (use as-is, wrapper, or custom service)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All endpoint payloads documented
- [ ] Blocking behavior confirmed or workaround designed
- [ ] SSE integration validated
- [ ] Recommendation documented (implement or defer)

### Discovery #2: Templates Inventory (Forge vs. Genie)
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ HIGH
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Dependency:** Related to Wish #110 (Multi-template architecture)

**Objective:**
Inventory Forge's template system and decide unification strategy with Genie's "code/create" templates.

**Questions:**
1. What templates does Forge offer?
2. What metadata does each template contain (name, description, variables, files)?
3. Are Forge templates compatible with Genie's agent structure?
4. Can Forge templates be extended/customized?
5. Should we deprecate "code/create" in favor of Forge templates?
6. How do agent types map to Forge templates?

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Call `listTemplates()` and document all available templates
2. Call `getTemplate()` for each to extract full metadata
3. Compare with Genie's `.genie/agents/code/` and `.genie/agents/create/`
4. Test `createTemplate()` with custom template
5. Design mapping: agent type â†’ Forge template

**Deliverable:**

2. How do we map Forge profile IDs to Genie executor names?
3. What happens when an executor is unavailable?
4. Can we query executor capabilities (models, features)?
5. How does Forge's MCP configuration relate to Genie's MCP servers?
6. Should MCP be unified or separate?

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Call `listExecutorProfiles()` and document response
2. Call `getExecutorProfile()` for each profile
3. Design mapping: Forge profile ID â†’ Genie-friendly name
4. Test fallback when executor unavailable
5. Investigate `getMcpConfig()` and compare with Genie's MCP setup

**Deliverable:**
- `.genie/discovery/executors-discovery.md`

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Dependency:** SSE listener foundation (Group A)

**Objective:**
Define safe automatic actions that can be triggered on SSE events.

**Questions:**
1. What events are available via `subscribeToEvents()`?
2. What payloads do events contain?
3. What actions can we safely automate?
4. How do we ensure idempotency?
5. What retry logic is needed?
6. What should require user confirmation vs. automatic?

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Subscribe to SSE and capture all event types
2. Document event payloads for each type
3. Brainstorm automation opportunities (safe + valuable)
4. Design idempotency checks for each action
5. Design retry logic for transient failures
6. Categorize: automatic vs. confirm vs. manual-only

**Deliverable:**
- `.genie/discovery/sse-automations-catalog.md`
  - Complete event catalog (types + payloads)
  - Automation proposals (ranked by safety/value)
  - Idempotency design
  - Retry logic specification
  - User confirmation gates

**Example Automations:**
- `task_completed` â†’ Auto-pull logs, update wish status
- `pr_created` â†’ Auto-open review, notify Omni
- `approval_requested` â†’ Show CLI prompt, notify Omni
- `auth_failed` â†’ Guide user to re-login
- `system_error` â†’ Log to .genie/logs/, notify Omni

**Success Criteria:**

2. Are task attempts sufficient for versioning/A/B testing?
3. Would auto-checkpoints help or add noise?
4. How often would users manually save/restore drafts?
5. What storage/performance implications exist?

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Review task attempt system (is it sufficient?)
2. Interview potential users (would they use drafts?)
3. Prototype auto-checkpoint logic (when to trigger?)
4. Estimate storage cost (how many checkpoints per task?)
5. Compare: drafts vs. multiple task attempts

**Deliverable:**
