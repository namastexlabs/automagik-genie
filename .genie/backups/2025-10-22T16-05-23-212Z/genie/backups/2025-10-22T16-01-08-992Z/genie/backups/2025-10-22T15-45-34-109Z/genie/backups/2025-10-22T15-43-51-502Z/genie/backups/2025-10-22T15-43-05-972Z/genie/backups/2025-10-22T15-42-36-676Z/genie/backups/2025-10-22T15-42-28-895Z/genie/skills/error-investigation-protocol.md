# Error Investigation Protocol

**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`

**When to use:** Agent tool (Genie MCP, Forge MCP) shows error messages but system state is unclear

**Trigger:** Seeing "unreachable" / "failed" / "error" messages in agent output

**Action:** INVESTIGATE ‚Üí VERIFY ‚Üí DECIDE (never panic and bypass)

---

## The Anti-Pattern (NEVER DO THIS)

```
See error message
  ‚Üì
Assume system is broken
  ‚Üì
Try to do work directly
  ‚Üì
Create redundant sessions
  ‚Üì
Bypass delegation
  ‚Üì
Create chaos and lose work
```

**Evidence:** RC 37 release failure (2025-10-21)
- Saw "Forge backend unreachable" in `genie view`
- Panicked and tried to execute release manually
- Created 3 redundant release agent sessions
- Meanwhile, agents ACTUALLY COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- RC 37 published WITHOUT uncommitted changes
- Lost work due to panic response

---

## The Correct Pattern (ALWAYS DO THIS)

```
See error message
  ‚Üì
INVESTIGATE with monitoring tools
  ‚Üì
Check actual system state
  ‚Üì
Verify agent/process is running
  ‚Üì
Trust delegation if state is healthy
  ‚Üì
Wait with patience (use sleep intervals)
  ‚Üì
Check results when complete
```

---

## Investigation Toolkit

### When `genie view` Shows Errors

**1. Check Forge MCP connectivity:**
```
mcp__automagik_forge__list_tasks(project_id="...")
```
If this works, Forge is fine (ignore "unreachable" message from genie view)

**2. Check task status:**
```
mcp__automagik_forge__list_tasks(project_id="...", limit=5)
```
Look for your task in "in-progress" state

**3. Check process list:**
```bash
ps aux | grep <executor-name>
# Examples: opencode, claude, cursor, gemini
```
Verify executor is running

**4. Check Forge process:**
```bash
ps aux | grep forge
netstat -tlnp | grep 8887  # Forge default port
```
Verify Forge backend is running and listening

**5. Wait with monitoring intervals:**
```bash
sleep 30  # Don't poll every second - be patient
# Then check status again
```

**6. When advanced tools available:**
```
mcp__automagik_forge__adv_get_task_attempt(attempt_id="...")
mcp__automagik_forge__adv_get_process(process_id="...")
```
(Note: Requires --advanced flag, may not be enabled)

## Decision Tree

```
Error message appears
    ‚Üì
Check Forge MCP (list_tasks)
    ‚Üì
‚îú‚îÄ Works ‚Üí Forge is fine, trust delegation
‚îÇ   ‚Üì
‚îÇ   Check task status
‚îÇ   ‚Üì
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ in-progress ‚Üí Wait patiently with sleep intervals
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ in-review ‚Üí Work complete, check results
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ completed ‚Üí Success, verify output
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ failed ‚Üí Investigate failure (read logs, check diffs)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Fails ‚Üí Forge is actually broken
    ‚Üì
    Check Forge process
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ Running ‚Üí Port/config issue, check netstat
    ‚îÇ   ‚Üì
    ‚îÇ   Check correct port (8887 vs 8888 confusion)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ Not running ‚Üí Report blocker, restart Forge
```

## Trust But Verify Protocol

### Trust
- Agent sessions continue running even when view is broken
- Forge executes tasks even when CLI shows errors
- Executors (OpenCode/Claude/etc.) complete work autonomously
- System is more robust than display suggests

### Verify
- Use monitoring tools to check actual state
- Check process list to confirm execution
- Use Forge MCP to get real task status
- Wait for completion before assuming failure

### Never
- Bypass delegation due to display bugs
- Create redundant sessions without investigating
- Attempt direct execution when agents are working
- Panic and lose uncommitted work

---

## Common Display Bugs vs Real Failures

### Display Bug: "Forge backend unreachable"

**Symptoms:**
- `genie view` shows "Forge backend unreachable"
- But `mcp__automagik_forge__list_tasks` WORKS
- Process list shows Forge running
- Task status shows "in-progress"

**Diagnosis:** Genie CLI display bug, not real failure

**Action:** Ignore "unreachable" message, trust delegation

**Root cause:** Port confusion (8888 vs 8887) or HTTP health check instead of MCP connectivity check

### Display Bug: "No logs available"

**Symptoms:**
- `genie view` shows "(No logs available)"
- But task status shows "in-progress"
- Executor process is running

**Diagnosis:** Log streaming issue, not execution failure

**Action:** Monitor via Forge MCP task status instead

### Real Failure: Task Status "failed"

**Symptoms:**
- Task status shows "failed"
- Executor process not running
- No recent activity in worktree

**Diagnosis:** Actual execution failure

**Action:** Investigate failure (read logs, check diffs, review error messages)

---

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Patience Over Polling

**‚ùå Wrong:**
```bash
while true; do
  check_status
  sleep 1  # Polling every second
done
```

**‚úÖ Correct:**
```bash
# Check once, then wait
check_status

# If in-progress, wait longer
sleep 30  # or 60 seconds

# Check again
check_status
```

### Progressive Intervals

**Pattern:**
```
First check: Immediate
Second check: 30 seconds later
Third check: 60 seconds later
Ongoing: 60-120 second intervals
```

**Why:** Reduce system load, avoid spam, respect execution time

### State-Based Decisions

**Don't decide based on:**
- Error messages in view output
- Missing logs
- Display timeouts

**Do decide based on:**
- Task status from Forge MCP
- Process existence in `ps aux`
- Actual file changes in worktree
- Commit history in git log

## Evidence

### Session Demonstrating Correct Pattern (2025-10-21)

**Scenario:** While analyzing RC 37 failure, encountered same "unreachable" error

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Checked Forge MCP connectivity
mcp__automagik_forge__list_tasks(project_id="...")
# Result: SUCCESS - full task list returned

# Checked task status
Task 1d824e13-936b-4182-a49f-9198eb2fd087: "in-progress"

# Checked processes
ps aux | grep opencode
# Result: OpenCode executor running (PID 1002766)

# Checked Forge
ps aux | grep forge
netstat -tlnp | grep 8887
# Result: Forge running on port 8887

# Conclusion: Display bug, not real failure
# Action: Trusted delegation, waited patiently
```

**Outcome:** Work continued successfully despite error messages

## Integration with Other Skills

### Combine with:
- `@.genie/skills/delegate-dont-do.md` - Don't bypass delegation due to errors
- `@.genie/code/skills/genie-integration.md` - Monitoring patterns for Genie MCP
- `@.genie/code/skills/forge-integration.md` - Forge task status checking

### When to escalate:
- Forge MCP actually fails (not just display error)
- Process definitely not running
- Task status stuck for >10 minutes with no activity
- Repeated failures with clear error patterns

---

## Future Improvements

**Genie CLI fixes needed:**
1. Fix "Forge backend unreachable" false positives
2. Add real-time status polling to `genie view`
3. Create `genie status` command for health checks
4. Implement session‚Üítask‚Üíattempt mapping
5. Use Forge advanced APIs for monitoring

**See:** `.genie/reports/rc37-failure-analysis-20251021.md` for detailed recommendations

## Validation

**Before panicking about errors, validate:**
- [ ] Checked Forge MCP connectivity (list_tasks)
- [ ] Checked task status (in-progress vs failed)
- [ ] Checked process existence (ps aux)
- [ ] Waited appropriate interval (30-60 seconds)
- [ ] Verified this is NOT just a display bug

**Only bypass delegation if:**
- [ ] Forge MCP actually fails (not display bug)
- [ ] Process confirmed not running
- [ ] Task status confirmed failed
- [ ] Blocker documented and reported

**Remember:** Display bugs ‚â† System failures. Investigate before acting. Trust but verify. üßûüîç‚úÖ
