## Context Ledger
| Source | Type | Summary | Routed To |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.genie/code/teams/tech-council/*` | repo | Modern council location | wish |
| Legacy council files (removed): `.genie/agents/{jt,nayr,oettam}.md` | note | Confirmed superseded; deleted | wish |
| diffs (attached) | file | Legacy vs modern differences | validation |
| scan scripts | script | Repo-wide @ ref validation | validation |

## Executive Summary
We have two agent-era structures: legacy `@.genie/agents` and modern collectives under `@.genie/code/*` (and `@.genie/create/*`). This wish unifies the folders, updates references, and archives legacy files after migration. We will attach diffs, update AGENTS.md references, and provide a check script to prevent regressions.

## Current State
- Legacy: council personae were at `.genie/agents/{jt,nayr,oettam}.md` (now removed)
- Modern: council lives under `@.genie/code/teams/tech-council/` and code agents under `@.genie/code/agents/*`
- Observed outdated references in `AGENTS.md` (fixed) and legacy README with non-existent paths

## Target State & Guardrails
- Single source of truth: domain collectives (`@.genie/code/*`, `@.genie/create/*`)
- Teams live under `<collective>/teams/*`
- Agents live under `<collective>/agents/*`
- Legacy `@.genie/agents/*` archived or converted to docs (no active references)

## Execution Groups
### Group A â€“ tech-council-unify
- Goal: Align council personae to modern path
- Surfaces: `@.genie/agents/{jt,nayr,oettam}.md`, `@.genie/code/teams/tech-council/*`
- Deliverables: migration decision (source of truth), legacy pointers/archives
- Evidence: `validation/group-a/` diffs + decision note

### Group B â€“ references-update
- Goal: Update repo references to use modern paths
- Surfaces: `AGENTS.md`, any other `@.genie/agents/*` refs
- Deliverables: PR-ready patch; scan output
- Evidence: `validation/group-b/` scan logs before/after

### Group C â€“ legacy-archive
- Goal: Archive or convert `.genie/agents/README.md` â†’ `.genie/docs/agents-architecture.md` with note
- Surfaces: `.genie/agents/README.md`
- Deliverables: moved/renamed file, deprecation banner
- Evidence: `validation/group-c/` outputs

### Group D â€“ guardrail-checks
- Goal: Add and run repo checker for `@.genie/` references
- Surfaces: scan script under `.genie/scripts`
- Deliverables: `check-genie-refs.sh` + CI/local instructions
- Evidence: `validation/group-d/` run logs

## Verification Plan
- Run `check-genie-refs.sh` (added) and confirm 0 broken refs
- Confirm no references to `@.genie/agents/` remain (except archive note)
- Capture before/after scans and diffs in `validation/`

### Evidence Checklist
- Diffs: legacy vs modern council files
- Scan logs: before/after
- List of updated references
- Decision note: which files archived vs retained

## <spec_contract>
- Scope: Unify agent folders; update references; add guardrail script
- Out of scope: Creating new collectives (tracked separately)
- Success metrics: 0 broken refs; 0 active uses of `@.genie/agents/`; docs updated
- Dependencies: none

## Blocker Protocol
1. Pause and create `reports/blocker-<slug>-<timestamp>.md` if conflicts
2. Notify owner and await decisions
3. Resume once wish status/log updated
