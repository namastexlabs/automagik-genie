# Done Report: learn-forge-orchestration-patterns-20251020

## Learning Applied
Captured critical learnings about Forge orchestration patterns from Felipe's feedback on RC release task mistakes.

## Files Updated
- **.genie/code/workflows/forge.md**: Added "Orchestration Patterns" section with isolated worktrees, human merge gate, sequential dependencies, and parallel task guidelines
- **.genie/reports/forge-orchestration-pattern-20251020.md**: Created original learning document

## Scope of Changes
- Added orchestration patterns section to forge workflow documentation
- Documented common mistake patterns and correct execution sequences
- Integrated learnings into core forge planning guidance

## Evidence of Application
- Patterns now documented in forge.md for future reference
- Original learning preserved in reports folder
- No behavioral violations corrected (this was new pattern establishment)

## Monitoring Plan
- Watch for future orchestration mistakes in task dependencies
- Validate that forge plans include proper sequential/parallel task sequencing
- Track human merge gate adherence in execution workflows

## Follow-ups
- None required - learning integrated into existing documentation
