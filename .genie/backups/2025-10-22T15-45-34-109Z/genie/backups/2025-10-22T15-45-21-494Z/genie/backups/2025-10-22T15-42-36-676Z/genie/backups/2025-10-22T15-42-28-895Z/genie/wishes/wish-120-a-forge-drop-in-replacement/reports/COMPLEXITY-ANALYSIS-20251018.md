## Part 6: Recommendation - Split Into Multiple Wishes

### üö® CRITICAL INSIGHT

**Current wish is too complex for single execution.**

**Problems:**
1. **Timeline too long** (11-15 weeks): High risk of scope creep, changing requirements
2. **Too many unknowns** (Discovery phase = 25% of timeline): Can't accurately estimate
3. **Too many dependencies** (10+ dependencies): High coordination overhead
4. **Too many integration points** (14 systems): High chance of cascading failures
5. **Too many categories** (15 categories): Context switching overhead

**Recommendation:** üéØ **SPLIT INTO 3 WISHES**

---

### Wish #120-A: Core Executor Replacement (MVP)

---

### Wish #120-B: Enhanced Features (Post-MVP)
**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM
**Timeline:** 3-5 weeks
**Complexity:** üü° MEDIUM

**Scope:**
- Group B: Streaming + Inspection (8 tasks)

- Updating agent functional
- SSE automations safe + valuable
- All documentation complete

**Endpoints Covered:** Remaining unmapped

**Effort:** 80-160 hours (2-4 weeks)

**Risk:** LOW (nice-to-have features)

---

## Part 7: Complexity Comparison

### Single Wish (Current Approach)

**Pros:**
- Complete solution delivered at once
- No context switching between wishes
- All integration points addressed

**Cons:**
- 11-15 week timeline (too long)
- High risk of scope creep
- Large Discovery phase (unknowns)
- Difficult to estimate accurately
- No incremental value delivery
- High coordination overhead

**Overall Risk:** üî¥ HIGH

---

### Three Wishes (Recommended Approach)

**Pros:**
- Incremental value delivery (MVP in 5-7 weeks)
- Smaller, manageable scopes
- Clear success criteria per wish
- Can adjust based on learnings
- Easier to estimate
- Lower coordination overhead per wish
- Can pause/pivot between wishes

**Cons:**
- More planning overhead (3 wish documents)
- Context switching between wishes
- Integration points span multiple wishes
- May discover dependencies late

**Overall Risk:** üü° MEDIUM (much better)

---

## Part 8: Final Complexity Assessment

### Overall Complexity: üî¥ **VERY HIGH**

**Dimensions:**
- ‚úÖ **Technical Complexity:** VERY HIGH (94+ endpoints, 15 categories, 3 patterns)
- ‚úÖ **Timeline Complexity:** VERY HIGH (11-15 weeks, 3.75x multiplier)
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Complexity:** HIGH (10+ dependencies, Discovery blocks all)
- ‚úÖ **Risk Complexity:** HIGH (11 risks, 3 CRITICAL)
- ‚úÖ **Integration Complexity:** VERY HIGH (14 systems, 4.67x multiplier)
- ‚úÖ **Task Complexity:** VERY HIGH (62+ tasks, 3.1x multiplier)
- ‚úÖ **Effort Complexity:** VERY HIGH (440-600 hours, 3.75x multiplier)

**Complexity Score:** 8.1/10 (VERY HIGH)

---

### Recommended Action: üéØ **SPLIT INTO 3 WISHES**

**Rationale:**
1. **Single wish too risky** (11-15 weeks, too many unknowns)
2. **Incremental delivery better** (MVP in 5-7 weeks)
3. **Easier to estimate** (smaller scopes, clearer deliverables)
4. **Lower coordination overhead** (per wish)
5. **Can adjust based on learnings** (pivot between wishes)

**Next Steps:**
1. Create Wish #120-A (Core MVP) - 5-7 weeks
2. Execute and validate
3. Learn from Wish #120-A
4. Create Wish #120-B (Enhanced) - 3-5 weeks (if needed)
5. Execute and validate
6. Create Wish #120-C (Optimization) - 2-4 weeks (if needed)

**Total Timeline:** Still 11-15 weeks, but **incremental value** + **lower risk**

- Executors discovery (flexibility)
- Advanced features (retarget, editor, switching)
- Streaming features (UX enhancement)

### Medium Value, Low Risk (Do Third - Wish #120-C)
- Migration tools (smooth transition)
- Updating agent (version management)
- SSE automations (efficiency)
- Image advanced features (nice-to-have)

### Low Value, High Risk (Defer/Reject)

## Conclusion

**Wish Complexity:** üî¥ **VERY HIGH** (8.1/10)

**Original Estimate:** 4 weeks, 20 tasks, MEDIUM complexity
**Current Reality:** 11-15 weeks, 62+ tasks, VERY HIGH complexity
**Multiplier:** 3.75x increase (275-375%)

**ROOT CAUSE:** Endpoint mapping revealed 70+ additional endpoints (Categories 6-15) that need natural integration into Genie workflow.

**Recommendation:** üéØ **SPLIT INTO 3 WISHES**
- Wish #120-A: Core MVP (5-7 weeks, CRITICAL)
- Wish #120-B: Enhanced Features (3-5 weeks, MEDIUM)
- Wish #120-C: Optimization (2-4 weeks, LOW)

**Benefits of Splitting:**
- ‚úÖ Incremental value delivery (MVP in 5-7 weeks vs. 11-15 weeks)
- ‚úÖ Lower risk per wish (MEDIUM vs. HIGH)
- ‚úÖ Easier to estimate (smaller scopes)
- ‚úÖ Can pivot based on learnings
- ‚úÖ Clear success criteria per wish

**Next Action:** Decide: proceed with single wish (11-15 weeks, HIGH risk) or split into 3 wishes (same total time, LOWER risk, incremental value)?
