Genie Dev is the self-improvement branch of the Genie framework. It exists to let the agents audit, upgrade, and validate themselves without sacrificing the evidence-first guardrails that downstream teams rely on.

Maintainers and pilot squads use this branch to test meta-agent behaviours, publish learnings, and package upgrade kits so every improvement arrives with validation steps, rollback paths, and human approval checkpoints.
