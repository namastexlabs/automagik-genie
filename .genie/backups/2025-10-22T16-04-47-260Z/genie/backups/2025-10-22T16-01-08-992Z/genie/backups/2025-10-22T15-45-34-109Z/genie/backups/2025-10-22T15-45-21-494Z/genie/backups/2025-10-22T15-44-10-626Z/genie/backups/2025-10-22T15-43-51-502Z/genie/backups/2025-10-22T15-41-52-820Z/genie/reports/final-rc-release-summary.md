## ðŸŽ¯ Session Achievements

### 1. âœ… Seven Amendments Framework Established
**Location:** `AGENTS.md` lines 70-150

**Documented:**
- Amendment #1: No Wish Without Issue (CRITICAL workflow rule)
- Amendment #2: File Organization Pattern (AGENTS.md structure)
- Amendment #3: Real-Time State Awareness (SESSION-STATE.md sync)
- Amendments #4-7: Reserved for future core rules

**Impact:**
- Clear workflow enforcement
- Prevents orphaned work
- Links GitHub issues â†’ Forge tasks â†’ PRs
- Foundation for future amendments

---

### 2. âœ… Complete GitHub â†” Forge Mapping
**Location:** `.genie/reports/forge-github-mapping-20251020.md`

**Findings:**
- 18 open GitHub issues
- 17 Forge tasks
- 3 issues properly mapped to tasks
- 15 issues need Forge tasks (violate Amendment #1)
- 14 tasks need GitHub issues (violate Amendment #1)

**Critical Bugs Without Tasks:**
- #151 - Forge API 422 error
- #150 - MCP path resolution breaks operations
- #148 - Wrong Forge port (3000 vs 8887)

**Action:** Create Forge tasks for critical bugs

---

### 3. âœ… Real-Time Forge Sync Architecture
**Location:** `.genie/reports/real-time-forge-sync-architecture.md`

**Design:**
- **Tier 1 (This RC):** MCP startup sync + Git hook auto-update
- **Tier 2 (Next RC):** 30s polling loop for near real-time
- **Tier 3 (Future):** Forge MCP resources for push-based updates

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Use existing Task 0d568ea8 (MCP Startup Sync)
2. Create pre-commit hook to auto-update SESSION-STATE.md
3. Redesign SESSION-STATE.md schema (machine + human readable)
4. Ship Tier 1 in this RC

**Benefits:**
- Genie always knows current Forge state
- Zero manual SESSION-STATE.md updates
- Foundation for autonomous orchestration

---

### 4. âœ… Codebase Validation Complete
**Validated Against:**
- Felipe's overnight commits (20 commits analyzed)
- Current Forge task statuses (17 tasks)
- SESSION-STATE.md accuracy (mismatches corrected)

**Key Discoveries:**
- Major architectural cleanup completed (flatten agents, remove legacy)
- Unified MCP startup implemented
- Forge manager + interactive start operational
- Multiple RC releases (rc.34, rc.35, rc.36)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Files Created This Session

1. `.genie/reports/forge-github-mapping-20251020.md` - Complete mapping table
2. `.genie/reports/real-time-forge-sync-architecture.md` - Sync design document
3. `.genie/reports/final-rc-release-summary.md` - This file

**Updates:**
- `AGENTS.md` - Added Seven Amendments section (lines 70-150)

---

## ðŸš€ Ready for Final RC

### Included in This RC:
- âœ… Seven Amendments documented
- âœ… Real-time sync architecture designed
- âœ… Complete mapping analysis
- âœ… Amendment #1 enforcement pattern
- âœ… SESSION-STATE.md schema redesign planned

### Implementation Required (Quick Wins):
1. Create pre-commit hook for SESSION-STATE.md auto-update
2. Implement MCP startup sync (Task 0d568ea8)
3. Update SESSION-STATE.md to new schema
4. Create Forge tasks for critical bugs (#151, #150, #148)

### Future Work (Post-RC):
- Tier 2 polling loop (30s intervals)
- Tier 3 Forge MCP resources
- Remaining amendments (#4-7)
- Complete issueâ†”task mapping enforcement

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

1. **Amendment Pattern Works:** Clear, numbered rules create enforcement foundation
2. **Mapping Essential:** Complete visibility prevents duplicate/orphaned work
3. **Real-Time Sync Critical:** Enables autonomous orchestration
4. **Tiered Approach:** Quick wins (startup + hooks) before complex solutions (polling, resources)

---

## ðŸŽ“ Educational Objective Achieved

**Felipe's Intent:** "Teach you how I want all the process done"

**What I Learned:**
1. **No work without GitHub issue** - Single source of truth
2. **Discovery before issue creation** - Proper routing to skills
3. **Real-time state awareness** - SESSION-STATE.md must be live
4. **Amendments framework** - Core workflow rules, numbered and enforced
5. **AGENTS.md pattern** - Root=full, .genie=alias (documented choice)

**Applied:**
- Created Learn task in Forge (c873572f)
- Validated codebase against reality
- Designed architecture before implementation
- Documented everything for future sessions
- Prepared for RC with clear action items

---

## âœ… Next Steps

**For Felipe:**
1. Review three reports (mapping, sync architecture, summary)
2. Approve RC release with current state
3. Execute critical bug Forge task creation (#151, #150, #148)

**For Implementation:**
1. Pre-commit hook (auto-update SESSION-STATE.md)
2. MCP startup sync (Task 0d568ea8)
3. SESSION-STATE.md schema update
4. Ship final RC

**Session Status:** âœ… COMPLETE - All learning objectives achieved, architecture designed, amendments documented
