## Context Ledger
| Source | Type | Summary | Routed To |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning brief | doc | Key findings | entire wish |
| `@path/to/file` | repo | Insight | wish, docs |
| mcp__genie__run agent="..." | background | Output summary | wish, roadmap |

## Discovery Summary
- **Primary analyst:** {Human/Agent}
- **Key observations:** â€¦
- **Assumptions (ASM-#):** â€¦
- **Open questions (Q-#):** â€¦
- **Risks:** â€¦

## Executive Summary
Concise outcome tied to user/system impact.

## Current State
- **What exists today:** `@file` references with short notes
- **Gaps/Pain points:** â€¦

## Target State & Guardrails
- **Desired behaviour:** â€¦
- **Non-negotiables:** latency, safety, human-likeness, compliance, etc.

## Execution Groups
### Group A â€“ {slug}
- **Goal:** â€¦
- **Surfaces:** `@file`, `@docs`
- **Deliverables:** â€¦
- **Evidence:** Store in wish `qa/group-a/`, add notes in `reports/` if needed
- **Suggested personas:** `forge-coder`, `forge-quality`
- **External tracker:** {placeholder ID or JIRA-XXX}

(Repeat for Group B/C as needed.)

## Verification Plan
- Validation steps or scripts to run (tests, metrics, evaluation)
- Evidence storage: reference wish `qa/` + `reports/` subfolders
- Branch strategy note (dedicated branch vs existing vs micro-task)

### Evidence Checklist
- **Validation commands (exact):** â€¦
- **Artefact paths (where evidence lives):** use wish `qa/` + `reports/`
- **Approval checkpoints (human sign-off required before work starts):** â€¦

## <spec_contract>
- **Scope:** â€¦
- **Out of scope:** â€¦
- **Success metrics:** â€¦
- **External tasks:** Tracker IDs (if any)
- **Dependencies:** â€¦
</spec_contract>

## Blocker Protocol
1. Pause work and create `reports/blocker-<slug>-<timestamp>.md` inside the wish folder describing findings.
2. Notify owner and wait for updated instructions.
3. Resume only after the wish status/log is updated.
