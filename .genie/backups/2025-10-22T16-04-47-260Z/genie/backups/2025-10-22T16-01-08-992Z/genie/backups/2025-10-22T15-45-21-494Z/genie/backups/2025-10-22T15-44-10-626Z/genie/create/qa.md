## Validation Checklists

### Research Outputs
- Sources cited with links and dates
- Cross-checked key claims (2+ independent sources)
- Bias and scope limits noted
- Evidence snapshots stored under `validation/`

### Writing Outputs
- Audience, purpose, and tone aligned with brief
- Clear structure (title, headings, logical flow)
- Style guide followed (`@.genie/standards/best-practices.md` or project-specific)
- Factual accuracy checks recorded in `validation/`
- Readability pass completed (note decisions in `reports/`)

### Editing & Review
- Line edits: clarity, grammar, concision
- Substantive edits: structure, argument strength
- Before/after diffs or notes saved
- Final approval noted in `reports/`

## Evidence Paths
- Base: `.genie/wishes/<slug>/`
- Validation: `validation/` (drafts, comparisons, citations, notes)
- Reports: `reports/` (approvals, blockers, done reports)

## Critical Edge Cases
- Missing style guide → request or extract inferred guidelines and document
- Ambiguous audience/goal → ask targeted questions; record assumptions
- Source conflicts → note discrepancies and chosen stance with rationale

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Evidence trail demonstrates care and accuracy
- ✅ Tone and structure match the brief
- ✅ Approvals captured before publishing or handoff
