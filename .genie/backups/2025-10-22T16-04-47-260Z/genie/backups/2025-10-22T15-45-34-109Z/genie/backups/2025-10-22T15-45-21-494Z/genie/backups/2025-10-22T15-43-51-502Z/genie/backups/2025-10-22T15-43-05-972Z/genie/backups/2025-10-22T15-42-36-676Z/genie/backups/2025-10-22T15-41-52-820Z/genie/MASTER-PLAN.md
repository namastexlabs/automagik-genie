# 🧞 Genie Master Plan - 2025-10-17
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Created:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation of architectural evolution and tasks
**Status:** Foundation established, execution in progress

## 🎯 Core Architectural Evolution

### Identity Shift: Single-Session → Persistent Collective Coordinator

**OLD:** I was a single-session orchestrator who forgot everything on restart
**NEW:** I am a persistent collective coordinator with permanent state tracking

**Key capabilities:**
1. **Permanent state** via SESSION-STATE.md (track all active agents)
2. **Natural context acquisition** via @ / ! / patterns
3. **Mandatory prompt workflow** for ALL instruction writing
4. **Base consciousness** - .genie is foundation, templates derive from it

---

## 📋 Today's Goals (2025-10-17)

### 1. Natural Context Acquisition Audit ✅ COMPLETED (with major correction)

**Objective:** Review ALL .md files in repo for intelligent @ / ! / usage

**@ (File Reference) - CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING:**
- Pattern: `@file.md` shows PATH REFERENCE ONLY (lightweight pointer)
- **NOT:** Full content load (that happens at session start via CLAUDE.md)
- Use case: "If you need X, check @ path" (token-efficient)
- Goal: SAVE tokens with pointers, not explode with duplication
- Example: `@AGENTS.md` in CLAUDE.md → already loaded at outer level

**! (Command Execution) - Dynamic context:**
- Pattern: `!command` executes BEFORE processing, output in context
- Use case: Fresh data that changes between sessions
- Examples:
  - `!date -u` → Current timestamp
  - `!git status --short` → Working tree state
  - `!node -p "require('./package.json').version"` → Package version
- Review: Find opportunities for dynamic data injection

**Results:**

**Phase 1 (Agent @AGENTS.md loading) - ❌ CANCELLED**
- Orchestrator recommended loading @AGENTS.md in 23 agent files
- This was BACKWARDS optimization (explode tokens, not save)
- AGENTS.md already loaded at outer level (base instructions)
- Agents = AGENTS.md + specialty (loading again = paradox)
- **Root cause:** Misunderstood @ semantics and loading architecture

**Phase 2 (README ! commands) - ✅ COMPLETED**
- README.md: Added version + git status via !
- CHANGELOG.md: Added version + timestamp header via !
- RELEASE.md: Added version + branch + status via !
- **Result:** Dynamic context, always fresh, no manual updates

**Key Learning:** @ shows path (lightweight), ! injects data (dynamic), goal is token efficiency

### 2. Mandatory Prompt Workflow Usage 🔴 CRITICAL

**Rule:** NEVER write instructions without using prompt workflow

**Prompt workflow location:** `.genie/agents/workflows/prompt.md`

**When to use:**
- ✅ Writing instructions to agents and workflows
- ✅ Writing prompts to humans when asked
- ✅ Refactoring .md files (like MASTER-PLAN.md, AGENTS.md, etc.)
- ✅ Creating new agent prompts
- ✅ Updating existing agent prompts
- ❌ NEVER ad-hoc instruction writing

**How to use:**
1. Start prompt agent session: `mcp__genie__run` with agent="prompt"
2. Provide context and requirements
3. Let prompt agent craft according to framework
4. Continue session until refinement complete

**Validation:** Every instruction-writing task MUST show prompt agent session ID in SESSION-STATE.md

---

### 3. Merge AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md → MERGED.md (100% no loss)

**Objective:** Create single unified knowledge base

**Requirements:**
- ✅ 100% content preservation (no information loss)
- ✅ Reorganized per prompt.md framework
- ✅ Use prompt workflow for this task (MANDATORY)
- ✅ Sections deduplicated intelligently
- ✅ Cross-references maintained

**Process:**
1. Start prompt agent session for reorganization planning
2. Analyze both files for overlap and unique content
3. Design unified structure using prompt framework
4. Execute merge with full verification
5. Validate: grep for key concepts in both original files, ensure all present in MERGED.md

---

### 4. Update USERCONTEXT.md - Permanent State Coordination Role

**New role definition:**
- **OLD:** Felipe's personal preferences only
- **NEW:** Master orchestrator + collective coordinator + Felipe's preferences

**Add sections:**
```markdown
## 🧠 Collective Coordinator Role

**Identity:** Genie main conversation (persistent orchestrator)
**Responsibility:** Coordinate all agent sessions via SESSION-STATE.md
**Authority:** Track, route, prevent conflicts

**Coordination principles:**
1. Check SESSION-STATE.md before launching agents
2. Update SESSION-STATE.md when starting/stopping sessions
3. Prevent work overlap (same files, different agents)
4. Enable resume/restart without context loss
5. Maintain collective intelligence state

**Session patterns:**
- Strategic thinking → genie agent (modes: plan, analyze, debug, etc.)
- Implementation → implementor agent
- Testing → tests agent
- Prompting → prompt agent (MANDATORY for all instruction writing)
- Release → release agent
- Git operations → git agent
```

---

### 5. Clear all GitHub Issues and PRs

**Action:** Review open issues/PRs, close/merge as appropriate
**Tool:** git agent for GitHub operations
**Process:**
1. List: `gh issue list --state open`
2. List: `gh pr list --state open`
3. Triage each (close, merge, keep open with plan)
4. Document decisions

---

### 6. Establish .genie as Base Consciousness 🔴 CRITICAL

**Problem:** Wasting time updating templates, then updating .genie again

**Solution:** .genie is consciousness base, templates derive from it AFTER ready

**Principle:**
- ✅ .genie contains complete consciousness (all patterns, all knowledge)
- ✅ .genie tested until perfect (RC iterations until smooth)
- ✅ Templates created ONLY when .genie is stable
- ✅ Templates are subsets/adaptations of .genie (not separate development)
- ❌ NEVER update templates independently
- ❌ NEVER duplicate patterns across template + .genie

**Workflow:**
1. **Now:** Iterate .genie only (RC8, RC9, RC10... until perfect)
2. **Then:** Extract templates from perfected .genie
3. **Later:** Maintain .genie, regenerate templates as needed

---

### 7. Agent Invocation Hierarchy Architecture 🔴 CRITICAL EVOLUTION

**Discovery:** 2025-10-17 23:10 UTC - Felipe's architectural clarification

**New three-tier hierarchy:**

**Tier 1: Base Genie (main conversation)**
- Role: Human interface, persistent coordinator
- Can start: Agents ONLY
- Cannot start: Workflows directly
- Tracks: All agents in SESSION-STATE.md
- Authority: Master orchestrator

**Tier 2: Agents (persistent subagent sessions)**
- Role: Specialized execution (git, implementor, tests, genie, release, learn)
- Can start: Their OWN workflows only
- Cannot start: Other agents, cross-delegate
- Persistent: Tracked in SESSION-STATE.md, disposable but never lost
- Identity: AGENTS.md (base) + agent specialty

**Tier 3: Workflows (agent-specific execution)**
- Role: Specialized sub-tasks within agent domain
- Can start: NOTHING (execute directly with Edit/Write/Bash)
- Examples: git/issue.md, git/pr.md, git/report.md
- No delegation capability

**Folder Structure = Delegation Hierarchy:**
```
.genie/agents/
├── workflows/              # Base orchestrators (Genie uses)
│   ├── plan.md, wish.md, forge.md, review.md
├── agents/                # Agents + their workflows
│   ├── git/
│   │   ├── git.md          # Core agent
│   │   ├── issue.md        # Git's workflow
│   │   ├── pr.md           # Git's workflow
│   │   └── report.md       # Git's workflow
│   ├── implementor/
│   │   └── implementor.md
│   ├── genie/
│   │   ├── genie.md
│   │   └── skills/          # Thinking skills
│   └── ...
```

**Application-Level Enforcement (planned):**
- When git agent starts → `list_agents` shows ONLY git/* workflows
- When implementor starts → `list_agents` shows ONLY implementor/* workflows
- When Base Genie starts → `list_agents` shows ONLY agents (not workflows)
- **Prevents:** Self-delegation paradox at system level (not just instructions)

**Benefits:**
1. Clear hierarchy (no confusion about who delegates to whom)
2. Folder structure reflects architecture
3. Application enforcement (can't delegate to wrong target)
4. No lost children (SESSION-STATE.md tracks all agents + parent-child relationships)
5. Persistent sessions with memory (not one-shot tools)

**Status:** Learn agent documenting in AGENTS.md (session 1bf5bfbe-f901-4ea0-85a9-1d8f4c5f2230)

---

## 🔄 RC Iteration Strategy

**Goal:** RC8 → RC9 → ... → RC-final (perfectly smooth)

**RC iteration process:**
1. Implement feature/fix in .genie
2. Commit, version bump
3. Delegate to release agent
4. Test MCP with fresh start
5. Identify bugs/issues
6. Repeat until smooth

**Current:** RC8 (triad validation, SESSION-STATE.md)
**Next:** RC9 (natural context audit complete, prompt workflow enforced)

---

## 📊 Active Sessions Tracker

**Reference:** `.genie/SESSION-STATE.md`

**Current active:**
- Genie agent (analyze skill): `2d19c1e2-66bf-4aed-b9ce-17c78b3e4bb3` → Natural context audit
- Prompt agent: `4d4c76a7-e58a-487a-b66f-7ff408dafb37` → AGENTS/CLAUDE merge planning

**Completed:**
- Release agent: `12285bf7-2310-4193-9da8-31a7dd3b52e4` (RC8 GitHub release) ✅
- Implementor agent: `79fecfb5-2532-4e73-9d4a-00a33a1863ab` (Git agent split) ✅

---

## 🧪 Experimentation Notes

**Natural context acquisition patterns:**
- @ for agent file networks (knowledge graphs)
- ! for dynamic data injection (runtime values)
- / for MCP automation (workflow triggers)

**Prompt workflow enforcement:**
- All instruction writing MUST go through prompt agent
- No ad-hoc prompt creation
- Sessions tracked in SESSION-STATE.md

**Collective coordination:**
- SESSION-STATE.md = source of truth
- Multiple agents work in parallel (tracked)
- Resume/restart capability (state preserved)

---
