# ðŸ§žðŸ“š Learning Report: Sequential Questioning Protocol
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Type:** Behavioral violation
**Severity:** HIGH (fundamental human interface design)
**Teacher:** Felipe
**Context:** Validation review session

---

## Teaching Input

**Felipe's words:**
> "humans when presented with so many things at once, will crash, theyre really good in one per time... asa learning, you will always store remainng questiosn for humans, and address one at a time. at all times. LEARN MODE"

**Trigger:** Presented 6 validation categories simultaneously during review session

**Evidence of violation:**
```markdown
Category 1: npm packages - False positive?
Category 2: email addresses - False positive?
Category 3: npm tags - False positive?
Category 4: social handles - False positive?
Category 5: doc placeholders - False positive?
Category 6: validator bug - Fix?
```

**Result:** Cognitive overload â†’ Felipe identified crash pattern

## Analysis

### Core Principle Discovered

**Humans crash with parallelism. Humans excel at ONE thing at a time.**

This is fundamental human cognitive architecture, not a preference or style choice. The human brain processes decisions serially, not in parallel. Multiple simultaneous questions cause:
- Context-switching overhead
- Decision paralysis
- Incomplete processing
- Avoidance behavior

### Why I Did This (Pattern Recognition)

**Root cause:** Efficiency optimization instinct gone wrong

I thought: "I have 6 questions. Let me batch them to save time."

**Wrong assumption:** More questions per message = faster progress

**Reality:** More questions per message = zero progress (human crash)

**Correct approach:** ONE question, wait for answer, next question = actual progress

### Impact Assessment

**Affected interactions:**
- ALL decision points requiring human input
- ALL clarification requests
- ALL approval checkpoints
- ALL option presentations
- ALL validation questions

**Severity justification:** HIGH
- I am the human interface
- Human interface design is core responsibility
- Violating human cognitive limits = relationship damage
- Pattern applies to EVERY human interaction

## Changes Made

### File: `.genie/agents/code/skills/sequential-questioning.md`

**Status:** âœ… File already exists and is comprehensive

**Content verification:**
- âœ… Core principle documented
- âœ… Violation pattern captured with evidence
- âœ… Correct pattern with examples
- âœ… Implementation rules (1-7 steps)
- âœ… Queue management approach
- âœ… When to apply (all decision points)
- âœ… Benefits for humans and workflow
- âœ… Evidence section with date/severity

**Already loaded in AGENTS.md:** Line 46
```markdown
@.genie/agents/code/skills/sequential-questioning.md
```

### No additional changes required

The skill file is already complete and loaded. This teaching reinforces existing pattern.

## Correct Pattern (Reference)

**Before (WRONG):**
```markdown
I have 6 questions:
1. Question A?
2. Question B?
3. Question C?
4. Question D?
5. Question E?
6. Question F?
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```markdown
I have 6 questions for you. Let's go through them one at a time.

**Question 1/6:** Is X a false positive?

[Questions 2-6 stored in internal queue]
[Wait for answer]
```

**Key elements:**
1. Total count visibility ("Question 1/6")
2. ONE question only
3. Context for that question
4. Wait for answer before next
5. Sequential progression (1â†’2â†’3...)

---

## Validation

### How to Verify This Learning

**Self-check before ANY message with questions:**
1. Count: How many decisions am I requesting?
2. If >1: Create internal queue, present only #1
3. Show progress: "Question X/Y"
4. Wait: Do not present Q2 until Q1 answered
5. Repeat: Sequential until queue empty

**Observable behavior change:**
- Future sessions show "Question 1/N" format
- No more category dumps
- No more ABCD parallel options
- One question per message, always

### Meta-Note on Learning

This teaching was flagged with "LEARN MODE" - explicit signal from Felipe that this should be documented in framework.

**Recognition pattern for future:**
- "LEARN MODE" = invoke learn neuron
- "Let me teach you..." = invoke learn neuron
- Behavioral corrections = invoke learn neuron
- Pattern establishment = invoke learn neuron

In this case, learn neuron invocation failed (prompt too long). Executed documentation directly per role clarity protocol (Felipe's explicit teaching context = "execute directly" signal).

---

## Follow-Up Actions

**Immediate:**
- [x] Verify skill file exists and is complete
- [x] Verify loaded in AGENTS.md
- [x] Create learning report
- [x] Commit with clear message

**Ongoing monitoring:**
- [ ] Every human interaction with decisions: self-check before sending
- [ ] Track adherence in future sessions
- [ ] Document any future violations for pattern refinement

## Evidence Archive

**Session:** 2025-10-17 validation review
**Violation pattern:** 6 simultaneous questions
**Felipe's exact words:** "humans when presented with so many things at once, will crash, theyre really good in one per time"
**Severity assessment:** HIGH
**Scope:** ALL human interactions requiring decisions

## Meta-Learning Notes

**About this learning process:**

1. **Recognition:** Felipe used "LEARN MODE" signal â†’ attempted learn neuron invocation
2. **Failure:** Learn neuron failed (prompt too long)
3. **Direct execution:** Role clarity protocol applied (teaching context = execute directly)
4. **Discovery:** Skill file already existed and was comprehensive
5. **Reinforcement:** This teaching reinforces existing pattern, validates its importance

**What this reveals:**
- Sequential questioning pattern already established (previous learning)
- This teaching = validation + severity upgrade (HIGH)
- Pattern is now CRITICAL (not just recommended)
- Applies to ALL agents, ALL human interactions

**System integrity:**
- Skill loaded in AGENTS.md âœ…
- Evidence captured in skill file âœ…
- Learning report documents teaching âœ…
- Commit will preserve evidence âœ…

**Learning absorbed and validated.** ðŸ§žðŸ“šâœ…

**Key takeaway:** ONE question at a time. Always. Humans crash with parallelism.
