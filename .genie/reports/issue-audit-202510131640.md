## Systemic Issues

### 1. Roadmap Linkage Inconsistency

**Problem:** Local roadmap.md only documents Phase 0-4 framework structure, not numbered initiatives.

**Evidence:**
- Issue #41 claims Initiative #29 → doesn't exist in .genie/product/roadmap.md
- Issue #40 claims "EXEC-PROVIDER" → doesn't exist
- Issue #37 claims "INIT-TEMPLATES" → doesn't exist

**Solution:** Either:
- (A) Populate roadmap.md with numbered initiatives matching external automagik-roadmap repo
- (B) Document that initiative numbers reference external repo (not local file)
- (C) Update issues to reference Phase numbers instead of initiative IDs

### 2. Status Misrepresentation

**Problem:** 4 issues claim "Active - Being implemented" with 0-5% actual completion.

**Evidence:**
- #40: Claims "Active" but only 5% implemented (--provider for init only)
- #38: Claims "Active" but 0% implemented (no code changes)
- #41: GitHub shows 0/13 criteria despite Phase 2 complete
- #37: Accurately claims "partial" (good example)

**Solution:**
- Require evidence (commit SHAs, file paths) when claiming implementation status
- Use "Ready for implementation" status for 0% issues
- Reserve "Active" for ≥10% implementation with recent commits

### 3. Template Non-Compliance

**Problem:** 2 issues (#17, #16) created as custom markdown without templates.

**Evidence:**
- #17: Plugin Marketplace (created before templates standardized?)
- #16: Enhanced Slash Commands (informal idea)

**Solution:**
- Close and recreate using proper templates
- OR mark as "ideas" (no formal tracking) if not prioritized

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Neglect

**Problem:** Issues with substantial work have 0% checkboxes marked.

**Evidence:**
- #41: Phase 2 complete but GitHub shows 0/13 checked
- #27: 15/24 complete but unchecked in issue body
- #31: 13/17 complete but unchecked in issue body

**Solution:**
- Update GitHub issue checkboxes as work progresses
- OR use wish document as single source of truth (sync issue periodically)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Roadmap Linkage (High Priority)**
   - Document initiative numbering convention (local vs external)
   - Update issues #41, #40, #37 with valid roadmap references
   - Create roadmap entries for claimed initiatives OR correct issue bodies

2. **Correct Status Misrepresentation (High Priority)**
   - Update #40 status: "Active" → "Ready for implementation" (5% ≠ active)
   - Update #38 status: "Active" → "Ready for implementation" (0% = not started)
   - Update #41 GitHub checkboxes to match Phase 2 completion

3. **Address Template Non-Compliance (Medium Priority)**
   - Close #17 and #16, recreate with proper templates
   - OR move to "ideas" backlog if deprioritized

### Process Improvements

1. **Mandate Evidence for Status Claims**
   - "Active - Being implemented" requires ≥10% completion + recent commits
   - Acceptance criteria checkboxes must be updated weekly
   - Wish documents must sync status to GitHub issues bi-weekly

2. **Roadmap Consistency**
   - Decide: local roadmap.md vs external reference
   - Document initiative numbering in AGENTS.md
   - Add validation: issues claiming initiatives must link to valid entries

3. **Acceptance Criteria Hygiene**
   - Update GitHub checkboxes as work completes
   - OR use wish evaluation matrix as authoritative (sync to issue monthly)
   - Add reminder in PR template: "Update issue checkboxes if acceptance criteria met"

## Summary

**Overall Health:** 27% compliance (3/11 PASS)

**Key Strengths:**
- Template adoption at 82% (recent improvement)

- 18% bypass template system entirely

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix roadmap linkage for #41, #40, #37 (high priority)
2. Correct status claims for #40, #38 (high priority)
3. Sync GitHub checkboxes with actual completion for #41, #31, #27
4. Document initiative numbering convention in AGENTS.md
