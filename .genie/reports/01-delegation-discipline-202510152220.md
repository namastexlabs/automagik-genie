# 🧞📚 Learning Report: Delegation Discipline Violation
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Sequence:** 01
**Type:** violation
**Severity:** critical
**Teacher:** Felipe
**Date:** 2025-10-15 22:20 UTC

## Teaching Input

Violation: Manual implementation instead of delegation

Evidence:
- Session 2025-10-16 22:30 UTC: Made 11 Edit calls to fix path references manually
- Should have delegated to implementor agent with clear spec
- Burned 13K tokens on repetitive edits instead of orchestrating
- Pattern: When orchestrator sees cleanup work, jumps to Edit tool instead of mcp__genie__run

Correction:
- ALWAYS delegate to specialist agents for implementation work
- Use Edit tool ONLY for single surgical fixes (≤2 files), not batch operations
- For any task requiring multiple file edits, create agent session
- Orchestrate, don't implement

Validation:
- Future cleanup tasks use mcp__genie__run with implementor/polish agents
- No more than 2 Edit calls per task before delegation
- Context updates track delegation vs manual work ratio

Target:
- AGENTS.md (critical_behavioral_overrides section)
- CLAUDE.md (delegation discipline pattern)
- .genie/agents/neurons/learn.md (self-document this learning)
- .genie/custom/routing.md (add delegation anti-patterns)

---

## Analysis

### Type Identified
Violation - Critical behavioral override needed

### Key Information Extracted
- **What:** Orchestrator made 11 manual Edit calls instead of delegating to implementor
- **Why:** "I'll just fix this quickly" mindset bypassed proper orchestration
- **Where:** Session 2025-10-16 22:30 UTC during path reference cleanup
- **How:** Should have created implementor session with clear spec listing 11 files needing updates

### Affected Files
- AGENTS.md: Critical behavioral overrides section (lines 677-711)
- CLAUDE.md: Delegation discipline pattern (lines 90-128)
- .genie/agents/neurons/learn.md: Meta-awareness anti-pattern (lines 751-753)
- .genie/custom/routing.md: Already has delegation guidance for orchestrators

---

## Status: ✅ ALREADY DOCUMENTED

### Discovery
Upon attempting to invoke learn agent (which failed), I discovered that:

1. **AGENTS.md** already contains the complete delegation discipline violation at lines 677-711:
   - Documents forbidden actions (Edit for batch ops, manual cleanup, "I'll just fix this")
   - Documents required workflow (delegate to implementor for >2 files)
   - Cites the specific violation: Session 2025-10-16 22:30 UTC, 11 Edit calls
   - Evidence: Session timestamp matches teaching input exactly

2. **CLAUDE.md** already contains the delegation discipline pattern at lines 90-128:
   - Includes concrete examples (WRONG: 11 edits, CORRECT: delegate)
   - Documents why it matters (token efficiency, separation of concerns, evidence trail)
   - Includes validation checklist

3. **learn.md** already contains meta-awareness at lines 751-753:
   - Anti-pattern: "When teaching delegation discipline, recognize this applies to learn agent itself"
   - Meta-learning note about embodying own teachings

4. **.genie/custom/routing.md** already has comprehensive delegation guidance for orchestrators

---

## Changes Made

### None Required

All target files already contain the required documentation. This learning was propagated either:
- By Felipe during or after the violation session
- By automated linter/formatter applying the pattern
- By the learn agent in a previous successful run

The documentation quality is excellent:
- ✅ Concrete violation cited with timestamp and file count
- ✅ Clear forbidden vs required patterns
- ✅ Evidence-based rationale (token efficiency, separation of concerns)
- ✅ Validation checklist (count files before Edit, track delegation ratio)
- ✅ Meta-awareness in learn.md itself

---

## Validation

### Current State Verification

**AGENTS.md** (lines 677-711):
```markdown
### Delegation Discipline *(CRITICAL)*
**NEVER** implement directly when orchestrating. **ALWAYS** delegate to specialist agents for multi-file work.

**Recent violation (2025-10-16):**
- Made 11 Edit calls for path reference cleanup manually
- Should have delegated to implementor with clear spec
- Burned 13K tokens on repetitive edits
- Pattern: See cleanup work → bypass delegation → implement directly
- **Result**: Context bloat, poor separation of concerns
- **Evidence**: Session 2025-10-16 22:30 UTC
```

**CLAUDE.md** (lines 107-116):
```markdown
**Example (WRONG):**
> *Sees 11 path references to fix*
> *Makes 11 Edit calls manually*
> Result: 13K tokens burned, context bloat, poor separation of concerns

**Example (CORRECT):**
> *Sees 11 path references to fix*
> "This is multi-file cleanup work. Let me delegate to implementor..."
> *Creates implementor session with clear spec*
> Result: Token-efficient, clean evidence trail, proper separation
```

**learn.md** (lines 751-753):
```markdown
- ❌ **Meta-awareness:** When teaching delegation discipline, recognize this applies to learn agent itself (don't teach patterns you violate)

**Meta-learning note:** The delegation discipline pattern (orchestrators delegate, specialists implement) applies to all orchestration contexts, including this learn agent when it coordinates multi-file propagation work. This agent should be aware of its own teachings and embody them.
```

### How to Verify

Future sessions should exhibit:
1. **Pre-edit file count check**: Before using Edit, count affected files
2. **Delegation trigger**: If >2 files, immediately invoke `mcp__genie__run with agent="implementor"`
3. **Context tracking**: Updates to .genie/CONTEXT.md track delegation vs manual work ratio
4. **Learning reinforcement**: When delegation occurs, note it as correct pattern application

**Test command:**
```bash
# Verify documentation exists
grep -n "Delegation Discipline" AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
grep -n "Meta-awareness" .genie/agents/neurons/learn.md

# Count violations documented
grep -c "Made 11 Edit calls" AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

## Follow-up Actions

- [x] Verify learning already documented in all target files
- [x] Confirm evidence matches (Session 2025-10-16 22:30 UTC)
- [x] Check meta-awareness in learn.md itself
- [ ] **Monitor next multi-file cleanup task**: Does agent delegate or fall back to Edit?
- [ ] **Track delegation ratio**: Update .genie/CONTEXT.md with delegation vs manual work counts
- [ ] **Escalate if pattern repeats**: If delegation bypassed again, create GitHub issue for systematic fix

---

## Evidence

### Before (Violation State)
Session 2025-10-16 22:30 UTC:
- Task: Fix 11 path references (core/ → neurons/)
- Action taken: 11 sequential Edit tool calls
- Token cost: ~13K tokens
- Result: Context bloat, poor separation of concerns
- Pattern: Orchestrator saw cleanup work → implemented directly → bypassed delegation

### After (Documented State)
Current documentation state:
- AGENTS.md: Full violation entry with timestamp, file count, evidence
- CLAUDE.md: Concrete examples (WRONG: 11 edits vs CORRECT: delegate)
- learn.md: Meta-awareness anti-pattern
- All files include validation guidance

## Meta-Notes

### Learn Agent Invocation Failure

Attempted to invoke learn agent via:
```
mcp__genie__run with agent="learn" and prompt="Violation: ..."
```

**Result:** Failed with command execution error
**Debug output:**
```
[DEBUG] execConfig.permissionMode = bypassPermissions
[DEBUG] Added --dangerously-skip-permissions (for bypassPermissions mode)
Command failed: /home/namastex/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/node ...
```

**Analysis:**
- Learn agent has `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` in frontmatter (line 8)
- CLI debug shows permission mode applied correctly
- Failure occurred after permission configuration
- Likely unrelated to permission mode - possible agent initialization issue

**Workaround Applied:**
- Verified documentation manually via Read tool
- Created learning report directly
- Discovered all work already complete

### Self-Awareness Observation

The learn agent demonstrates excellent self-awareness:
- Lines 751-753: Recognizes delegation discipline applies to itself
- Meta-learning note: "This agent should be aware of its own teachings and embody them"
- Anti-pattern: Don't teach patterns you violate

This is exactly the kind of meta-cognitive awareness that makes the learning system work - the agent can reflect on whether it's following the patterns it teaches.

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Learning already absorbed and propagated successfully.**

This teaching input was redundant - the violation had already been documented comprehensively across all target files. The documentation quality is excellent with:
- Concrete evidence (timestamp, file counts, token costs)
- Clear patterns (forbidden vs required actions)
- Validation guidance (how to verify in future sessions)
- Meta-awareness (learn agent recognizes its own teachings apply to itself)

**No further action required.** The framework already embodies this learning.
