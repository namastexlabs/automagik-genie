## Recommended Commit Message (USED)

```
learn: add template selection matrix to prevent GitHub issue template confusion

- Add decision tree to git-workflow.md for choosing correct template
- Reinforce AGENTS.md template rules with visual emphasis (⚠️)
- Document violation: Issue #40 used Make a Wish instead of Planned Feature
- Capture learning report: template-selection-learn.md

Fixes: Recurring template misuse by git-workflow agent
Context: Issue #40 had wish document but used external user template
Prevention: Clear rules - Make a Wish ONLY for external users, Planned Feature when wish exists

## Root Cause Analysis

**Violation:** git-workflow agent used "Make a Wish" template (external user format) for Issue #40, which had an existing wish document at `.genie/wishes/provider-runtime-override/`

**Contributing factors:**
1. Agent lacked explicit template selection guidance
2. Three "wish" concepts caused confusion:
   - "Make a Wish" GitHub issue template (external)
   - `/wish` Genie command (creates documents)
   - Wish documents (`.genie/wishes/<slug>/`)
3. No decision tree for template selection

**Solution implemented:**
1. Added template selection matrix to git-workflow.md
2. Reinforced rules in AGENTS.md with visual emphasis
3. Created learning report documenting violation and prevention

## Prevention Measures

**Future git-workflow agent behavior:**
- Will read template selection section before creating issues
- Will check if wish document exists: `test -d ".genie/wishes/<slug>"`
- Will use decision tree to select correct template
- Will NEVER use "Make a Wish" for internal work
- Will ALWAYS include wish document path in issue body when using Planned Feature template

**Validation command for agent:**
```bash
# Before creating issue, agent should run:
test -d ".genie/wishes/<slug>" && echo "Use planned-feature template" || echo "Use feature-request or bug-report"
```

## Risks & Follow-ups

**Risks:** None - documentation-only changes

**Follow-up actions:**
- [ ] Monitor next git-workflow agent issue creation (verify correct template usage)
- [ ] Validate with team that template distinctions are clear
- [ ] Consider adding template selection validation to CI/CD

## External Actions Completed

**Outside of git:**
1. Issue #40 edited via `gh issue edit` (corrected body to Planned Feature format)
   - Changed from Make a Wish fields to Planned Feature fields
   - Added roadmap initiative number: EXEC-PROVIDER
   - Added wish document link: `.genie/wishes/provider-runtime-override/`

2. Issue #41 created via `gh issue create` (tracking issue for core-template-separation)
   - Used Planned Feature template
   - Links to: `.genie/wishes/core-template-separation/`
   - URL: https://github.com/namastexlabs/automagik-genie/issues/41

## Notes

**Template name was already correct:** No rename needed - "Make a Wish" already sufficiently differentiated from "wish document". The problem was missing agent guidance, not template naming.

**Automation unchanged:** link-to-roadmap.yml workflow was already correct (only processes `planned-feature` labeled issues). We just needed to use the right template.

**Learning captured successfully:** Complete violation → analysis → fix → prevention cycle documented in learning report.

**Advisory complete. Commit successful.** ✅
