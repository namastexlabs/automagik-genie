# ðŸ§žðŸ“š Learning Report: Routing Violation (2025-10-17)
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Sequence:** 01
**Context ID:** routing-violation
**Type:** violation
**Severity:** high

## Teaching Input

```
Violation: Failed routing to release agent

Evidence:
- Session 2025-10-17 ~00:50Z
- User: "we got release agent, you failed routing"
- I attempted to handle RC5 release directly instead of delegating
- Said "I'm learning" but didn't document in AGENTS.md

Correction:
- Release operations MUST route to release agent (not orchestrator/main)
- When user points out routing failure, use learn agent immediately
- "Learning" means documenting in AGENTS.md, not just acknowledging

Validation:
- Check AGENTS.md routing section mentions release agent
- Future release requests route correctly
- Learn agent invoked when behavioral corrections needed

Target:
- AGENTS.md Â§routing_decision_matrix
- AGENTS.md Â§critical_behavioral_overrides (Publishing Protocol section)

Context:
This is meta-learning about following my own framework. I'm Genie building Genie - my behavior models template behavior.
```

## Analysis

### Type Identified
Violation (routing discipline failure) + Meta-violation (learning process failure)

### Key Information Extracted
- **What:** Failed to delegate RC5 release work to release agent
- **Why:** Recognized release work but bypassed routing discipline
- **Where:** Routing matrix (lines 1166-1208) and Publishing Protocol (lines 850-892)
- **How:** Add explicit routing check and meta-learning trigger

### Affected Files
- AGENTS.md: Both sections need violation entries (routing + publishing)

---

## Changes Made

### File 1: AGENTS.md (Publishing Protocol)

**Section:** Â§critical_behavioral_overrides â†’ Publishing Protocol
**Edit type:** Already documented (lines 884-891)

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Content:**
```markdown
**Recent violation (2025-10-17):**
- Session ~00:50Z: Recognized RC5 release work but attempted direct handling
- Failed to check routing matrix before acting on release request
- Acknowledged "I'm learning" but did NOT invoke learn agent for documentation
- **Result**: Routing pattern not propagated to framework
- **Evidence**: User teaching 2025-10-17
```

**Reasoning:** Documents the specific routing failure with meta-learning context

### File 2: AGENTS.md (Critical Routing Rules)

**Section:** Â§routing_decision_matrix â†’ Critical Routing Rules
**Edit type:** Already documented (lines 1188-1195)

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Content:**
```markdown
**Recent violation (2025-10-17):**
- Session ~00:50Z: Attempted RC5 release handling directly instead of delegating to release agent
- Pattern: Recognized release work but bypassed routing discipline
- Meta-violation: "I'm learning" acknowledgment without learn agent invocation
- **Result**: Routing pattern not propagated to framework
- **Evidence**: User teaching 2025-10-17
```

**Reasoning:** Emphasizes the routing pattern and meta-learning failure

---

## Validation

### How to Verify
1. Read AGENTS.md lines 884-891 (Publishing Protocol violation)
2. Read AGENTS.md lines 1188-1195 (Routing Rules violation)
3. Both sections contain 2025-10-17 violation entry
4. Meta-learning trigger documented: "invoke learn agent immediately"

### Follow-up Actions
- [x] Document violation in Publishing Protocol
- [x] Document violation in Critical Routing Rules
- [x] Add meta-learning trigger guidance
- [x] Generate learning report
- [ ] Monitor future sessions for correct routing behavior
- [ ] Validate learn agent invocation when user identifies routing failures

---

## Evidence

### Before
- User: "we got release agent, you failed routing"
- My response: "I'm learning" (acknowledgment only, no action)
- Pattern: Routing failure â†’ acknowledgment â†’ no documentation â†’ pattern not propagated

### After
- AGENTS.md lines 884-891: Violation documented with meta-learning context
- AGENTS.md lines 1188-1195: Violation documented with routing pattern emphasis
- Line 1186: "When user points out routing failures... immediately invoke learn agent"
- Line 891: "When user identifies routing failures, invoke learn agent immediately"
- Pattern: Routing failure â†’ invoke learn agent â†’ documentation â†’ pattern propagated

---

## Meta-Notes

**Key insight:** This is meta-learning about the learn agent itself.

**The violation teaches:**
1. Saying "I'm learning" without invoking learn agent = pattern not propagated
2. Learn agent IS the documentation mechanism, not just acknowledgment
3. When user identifies behavioral failures, immediate learn agent invocation required
4. This models correct behavior for all agents in the framework

**Meta-awareness:**
- I'm Genie building Genie
- My routing behavior becomes the template for all orchestrators
- Delegation discipline applies to ALL orchestration contexts (including learn agent delegation)
- This violation is now part of the training corpus for future sessions

**Framework impact:**
- Reinforces delegation discipline at meta-level
- Learn agent becomes required step for behavioral corrections
- "I'm learning" acknowledgment = promise to invoke learn agent
- Documentation completes the learning loop

**Learning absorbed and propagated successfully.** ðŸ§žðŸ“šâœ…

**Absorption method:** Manual surgical editing (learn agent MCP failed)
**Validation:** Both AGENTS.md sections contain complete violation entries
**Pattern propagated:** Meta-learning trigger now explicit in both sections
