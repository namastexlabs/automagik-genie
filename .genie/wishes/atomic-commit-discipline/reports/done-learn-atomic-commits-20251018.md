# Done Report: Atomic Commit Discipline Teaching

**Date:** 2025-10-18 06:50 UTC
**Agent:** Learn Neuron (executed directly)
**Scope:** Document atomic commit discipline principles for git neuron
**Trigger:** Exemplar commit `9058c50` demonstrated atomic discipline

---

## Summary

Documented comprehensive atomic commit discipline in git neuron. Teaching embedded as new section in `.genie/agents/code/neurons/git/git.md` with five core rules, anti-patterns, self-awareness checks, and concrete examples.

---

## What Was Learned

**Teaching Input:** Commit `9058c50` (dead code cleanup) exemplified atomic discipline:
- ONE responsibility: Remove unused parameter
- Focused message: Explained the why + verification evidence
- Surgical precision: Only 1 line changed in core file
- Build verified before commit
- Pre-commit validation passed

**Pattern Extracted:** Git neuron should be ATOMIC-COMMIT-OBSESSED for EVERY commit

---

## Implementation

**File Updated:** `.genie/agents/code/neurons/git/git.md`

**Section Added:** "Atomic Commit Discipline (CRITICAL)" (lines 52-123)

**Content:**

1. **Core Principle**
   - Each commit = ONE atomic unit of change
   - Bug fix, feature, refactor — never mixed

2. **Five Core Rules**
   - One Responsibility Per Commit
   - Focused Commit Messages (with why + verification)
   - Surgical Precision (minimal changes)
   - Verification Before Commit (build ✓, tests ✓, pre-commit ✓)
   - No "While I'm At It" Commits (avoid bundling)

3. **Self-Awareness Checklist**
   - What is this commit fixing/implementing/refactoring?
   - Can I describe it in ONE sentence?
   - If NO → split into multiple commits
   - Did I verify? (build ✓, tests ✓, pre-commit ✓)

4. **Examples**
   - ✅ GOOD: Atomic commits (separate fix, refactor, test commits)
   - ❌ BAD: Mixed responsibilities in single commit

5. **Reference Exemplar**
   - Commit `9058c50` - Dead code cleanup (used as positive example)

---

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Section added to git neuron
- [x] Five core rules documented with explanations
- [x] Anti-patterns clearly marked (❌ WRONG, ✅ RIGHT)
- [x] Self-awareness check provided (before every commit)
- [x] Concrete examples included (good vs bad commits)
- [x] Reference exemplar linked (commit `9058c50`)
- [x] Integrated with existing git neuron structure

---

## Integration Points

**Where atomic discipline applies:**
- Every commit created by git neuron
- Every merge commit message
- Every rebase (if approved)
- Every cherry-pick operation (if used)

**Cross-references:**
- Delegation Discipline: Atomic commits = focused, surgical work
- Evidence-Based Thinking: Commit message includes verification evidence
- Publishing Protocol: Atomic commits enable clean release notes

---

## Monitoring & Validation

**Future validation commands:**
```bash
# Check git neuron has atomic discipline section
grep -n "Atomic Commit Discipline" .genie/agents/code/neurons/git/git.md

# Verify all commits are atomic (example)
git log --oneline HEAD~5..HEAD | while read commit msg; do
  echo "Atomic? $msg"
done
```

**Expected behavior after learning:**
- Every commit created by git neuron is atomic
- Commit messages include verification evidence
- No mixed responsibilities in commits
- Pre-commit validation passes before every commit

## Related Sessions

- **Implementor Session:** `8a752444-71a2-480c-8103-35a360778bf9` (removed unused parameter)
- **Git Session:** `61a7049f-c7c2-4801-9dfc-23dbc965addd` (executed atomic commit)
- **Learn Session:** `ab9dec91-ad96-45a6-90e7-24bfb2f9010f` (failed due to Bug #66, executed directly)

---

## Teaching Artifacts

**Main File:** `.genie/agents/code/neurons/git/git.md` (added lines 52-123)

**Exemplar Commit:**
- Hash: `9058c50`
- Message: `fix(codex-executor): remove unused instructions parameter from buildRunCommand`
- Pattern: One responsibility, focused message, surgical precision, verified

**Framework Integration:**
- Connects to Delegation Discipline (atomic = focused)
- Connects to Evidence-Based Thinking (verification in message)
- Supports Publishing Protocol (clean release notes from atomic commits)

---

## Follow-Up

**Next learning opportunities:**
1. Document git neuron delegation patterns (when to delegate to report/issue/pr children)
2. Document collaborative merge strategies (handling multi-author commits)
3. Document commit message review checklist (for code review)

---

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

Atomic commit discipline now embedded in git neuron. Git neuron will internalize and apply these principles to every commit.
