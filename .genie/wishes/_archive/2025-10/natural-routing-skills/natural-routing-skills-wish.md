## Discovery Summary
- **Primary analyst:** Felipe + Orchestrator session 36e0999a-4ebe-4ce1-a8f0-0169ded2bee8
- **Key observations:**
  - Commit agent underutilized during v2.3.6 release
  - Orchestrator neuron provides 18 strategic thinking modes for Genie
  - Thinking modes lack clear "when to use" heuristics
  - Delegation threshold criteria undefined (file count, complexity, domain)
  - Recent infinite loop fix created routing.md as orchestrator-scoped guidance
- **Assumptions (ASM-#):**
  - ASM-1: Routing triggers in AGENTS.md would cause routing paradox (ALL agents load it)
  - ASM-2: Commit agent useful for multi-file commits with complex context
  - ASM-3: Strategic thinking modes can be clarified with natural routing triggers
  - ASM-4: Delegation thresholds can be defined with concrete criteria (â‰¥3 files, multi-domain, strategic)
- **Open questions (Q-#):**
  - Q-1: Should routing triggers live ONLY in routing.md to prevent paradox?
  - Q-2: Which of 18 strategic thinking modes are redundant or overlapping?
  - Q-3: What are concrete delegation thresholds? (file count, domain count, task type)
  - Q-4: How to make strategic thinking feel natural vs forced in conversation flow?
- **Risks:**
  - R-1: Routing paradox recurrence if triggers added to AGENTS.md
  - R-2: Over-routing could slow down simple tasks with unnecessary delegation
  - R-3: Context bloat from excessive routing guidance
  - R-4: Thinking mode clarification might remove useful specialized patterns

## Executive Summary
Enhance natural routing instincts for delegation vs direct execution by creating scoped routing triggers (avoiding routing paradox), clarifying 18 strategic thinking modes with natural heuristics, and defining concrete delegation thresholds. Builds on Genie's two-layer cognitive architecture: strategic thinking (via orchestrator neuron) and execution specialists (direct collaboration). Extends recent infinite loop fix (commit 0f45945) that created routing.md for orchestrator-scoped guidance.

## Current State
- **What exists today:**
  - @.genie/agents/code/routing.md (NEW from infinite loop fix) - orchestrator-specific routing guidance
  - @.genie/agents/code/neurons/commit.md - commit agent with pre-commit gate workflow
  - @AGENTS.md - global context loaded by ALL agents
  - Recent self-reference guards prevent infinite delegation loops
- **Gaps/Pain points:**
  - No routing triggers for when to suggest commit agent, orchestrator modes, or specialist delegation
  - Orchestrator feels like background tool, not user-facing strategic interface
  - 18 modes overwhelming without clear "when to use" guidance
  - Delegation threshold undefined (when to delegate vs execute directly?)
  - Commit agent missed during v2.3.6 release (no natural routing prompt)

## Target State & Guardrails
- **Desired behaviour:**
  - Natural routing to commit agent for multi-file commits with complex context
  - Proactive orchestrator suggestions for strategic questions ("I notice you're asking X, let me invoke orchestrator...")
  - Intuitive mode selection with clear keyword/pattern triggers
  - Concrete delegation thresholds (â‰¥3 files, multi-domain, strategic tasks)
  - No routing paradox or infinite loops
- **Non-negotiables:**
  - MUST NOT reintroduce routing paradox (routing triggers ONLY in routing.md, NOT AGENTS.md)
  - MUST preserve recent infinite loop fix architecture
  - MUST NOT slow down simple tasks with over-routing
  - MUST keep context bloat minimal (surgical additions only)
  - MUST validate no recursion introduced

## Execution Groups
### Group A â€“ Routing Trigger System (scoped to routing.md)
- **Goal:** Create routing triggers that suggest commit agent, orchestrator modes, and specialist delegation WITHOUT causing routing paradox
- **Surfaces:** `@.genie/agents/code/routing.md`, `@.genie/agents/code/neurons/commit.md`
- **Deliverables:**
  - Routing trigger definitions in routing.md ONLY (NOT AGENTS.md)
  - Commit agent trigger: multi-file commits, complex diffs, cross-domain changes
  - Orchestrator mode triggers: strategic questions, high-stakes decisions, deep analysis needs
  - Specialist delegation triggers: implementation work, testing, refactoring, git operations
  - Self-reference guards validation (no recursion)
- **Evidence:** Store conversation transcripts showing natural routing suggestions in `qa/group-a/routing-trigger-tests.md`, validation commands verifying no infinite loops
- **Suggested personas:** `implementor` (for routing.md edits), `review` (for validation)
- **External tracker:** TBD

### Group B â€“ Orchestrator Discoverability
- **Goal:** Reframe orchestrator as primary strategic interface with natural conversation patterns
- **Surfaces:** ``, `@AGENTS.md` (careful - global context!), `@CLAUDE.md`
- **Deliverables:**
  - Updated orchestrator.md positioning (user-facing strategic interface)
  - Proactive suggestion patterns for orchestrator invocation
  - Natural conversation templates ("I notice you're asking about X, this is a good case for orchestrator mode Y...")
  - Documentation updates emphasizing user-facing usage
- **Evidence:** Store before/after conversation examples in `qa/group-b/orchestrator-conversation-patterns.md`, user feedback on naturalness
- **Suggested personas:** `polish` (for conversation patterns), `docgen` (for documentation)
- **External tracker:** TBD

### Group C â€“ Mode Selection Heuristics
- **Goal:** Simplify 18 orchestrator modes with clear "when to use" heuristics and keyword triggers
- **Surfaces:** ``
- **Deliverables:**
  - Analysis of 18 modes identifying overlap/redundancy
  - Keyword/pattern triggers for each mode (e.g., "pressure-test" â†’ challenge, "root cause" â†’ debug)
  - Consolidated mode set if possible (merge similar modes)
  - "When to use" decision tree for each mode
  - Examples and anti-patterns for mode selection
- **Evidence:** Store mode analysis in `qa/group-c/mode-analysis.md`, keyword trigger mapping, before/after mode selection examples
- **Suggested personas:** `analyze` (for mode overlap analysis), `implementor` (for heuristics implementation)
- **External tracker:** TBD

### Group D â€“ Delegation Threshold Framework
- **Goal:** Define concrete delegation thresholds with decision tree and examples
- **Surfaces:** `@.genie/agents/code/routing.md`, `@AGENTS.md` (if safe - verify no paradox)
- **Deliverables:**
  - Complexity threshold criteria (â‰¥3 files, â‰¥2 domains, strategic vs tactical)
  - Task type classification (simple edit, refactor, feature, investigation)
  - Decision tree for "delegate vs execute directly"
  - Examples of threshold application
  - Anti-patterns (over-routing, under-routing)
  - Practice-based refinement notes
- **Evidence:** Store decision tree in `qa/group-d/delegation-decision-tree.md`, threshold application examples, validation of no over-routing
- **Suggested personas:** `implementor` (for threshold implementation), `review` (for validation)
- **External tracker:** TBD

## Verification Plan
- **Validation steps:**
  1. Test routing triggers with multi-file commit scenario (should suggest commit agent)
  2. Test orchestrator suggestions with strategic question (should invoke orchestrator naturally)
  3. Test mode selection with keyword patterns (should suggest appropriate mode)
  4. Test delegation threshold with 3+ file task (should delegate vs execute)
  5. Validate no infinite loops introduced (run self-reference guard tests)
  6. Validate no over-routing of simple tasks (single-file edit should execute directly)
- **Evidence storage:** Use `qa/` subfolders per group + `reports/` for validation summaries
- **Branch strategy:** Dedicated branch `feat/natural-routing-skills` recommended for this multi-group wish

### Evidence Checklist
- **Validation commands (exact):**
  ```bash
  # Test routing trigger for commit agent
  # (Interactive test - create multi-file commit scenario and observe suggestions)

  # Test orchestrator suggestion for strategic question
  # (Interactive test - ask strategic question and observe orchestrator invocation)

  # Test mode selection with keyword pattern
  # (Interactive test - use keyword like "pressure-test" and observe challenge mode suggestion)

  # Test delegation threshold
  # (Interactive test - propose 3+ file task and observe delegation vs execution)

  # Validate no infinite loops
  grep -r "mcp__genie__run.*orchestrator" .genie/agents/orchestrator.md
  # Should return ZERO results (orchestrator must not self-delegate)

  # Validate no over-routing
  # (Interactive test - propose single-file edit and observe direct execution)
  ```
- **Artefact paths (where evidence lives):**
  - `qa/group-a/routing-trigger-tests.md` - Routing trigger conversation transcripts
  - `qa/group-b/orchestrator-conversation-patterns.md` - Before/after orchestrator conversation examples
  - `qa/group-c/mode-analysis.md` - 18 mode overlap analysis, keyword mapping
  - `qa/group-d/delegation-decision-tree.md` - Threshold criteria, decision tree, examples
  - `reports/validation-summary.md` - Final validation results
- **Approval checkpoints (human sign-off required before work starts):**
  1. Confirm routing triggers ONLY in routing.md (NOT AGENTS.md) to prevent paradox
  2. Approve orchestrator positioning as user-facing vs background tool
  3. Review mode consolidation proposal (ensure no useful modes removed)
  4. Validate delegation threshold criteria (ensure no over-routing)
