# Plan → Wish Natural Flow Validation
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Purpose:** Validate that Genie can guide users through plan→wish invisibly
**Validation Date:** 2025-10-15
**Evidence Source:** This wish itself (natural-routing-skills)

## The Flow (What User Experiences)

```
User: "I want to build X"
Genie: [thinks strategically, no commands exposed]
Genie: "Here's what I'm thinking... [plan]. Sound good?"
User: "Yes"
Genie: [creates wish invisibly]
Genie: "I've captured this. Ready to break it down?"
```

**User never sees:** `/plan`, `/wish`, `/forge`, MCP calls, agent names
**User only sees:** Natural conversation

## Evidence from This Wish

**This wish itself demonstrates the flow working in production:**

### 1. Planning Phase (Invisible to User)

**What happened:**
- Session start: Felipe expressed need for natural routing enhancement
- Genie consulted orchestrator neuron (session `ce821e38-e5f8-481c-a7ab-81fc620653a5`)
- Orchestrator gathered context, analyzed scope, identified risks
- Genie presented plan naturally in conversation

**Evidence:**
- Status log entry (wish:266): "Orchestrator neuron completed mode overlap analysis"
- MCP session evidence (qa/mcp-session-evidence.md) documents neuron consultation
- No `/plan` command visible in user conversation
- Planning brief emerged from natural dialogue

**Validation:**
✅ Planning happened via neuron (not exposed command)
✅ Strategic thinking invisible to user
✅ Results presented naturally ("Here's what I'm thinking...")
✅ User approved without knowing mechanics

### 2. Wish Creation Phase (Invisible)

**What happened:**
- Genie created `.genie/wishes/natural-routing-skills/natural-routing-skills-wish.md`
- Full structure: context ledger, execution groups, spec contract, evidence checklist
- Folder structure: wish doc, qa/, reports/
- Mentioned casually in conversation: "I've captured this as a wish"

**Evidence:**
- Wish document exists with complete structure
- Status log shows creation timestamp (wish:259)
- User didn't invoke `/wish` command
- Conversation flow remained natural

**Validation:**
✅ Wish document created without command exposure
✅ All required structure present (context ledger, groups, spec contract)
✅ User aware of wish but not mechanics
✅ Natural conversation maintained

### 3. Forge Phase (Collaborative)

**What happened:**
- Groups A→D defined with clear deliverables
- Work breakdown presented naturally: "Here's how we'll tackle this..."
- Implementation proceeded through conversation
- User saw breakdown, not forge command syntax

**Evidence:**
- Execution groups clearly defined (wish:122-173)
- Implementation completed (Groups A+B in commit 9970916)
- Natural conversation in status log
- No forge command visible to user

**Validation:**
✅ Breakdown presented naturally
✅ Groups emerged from collaboration, not command output
✅ Implementation felt like conversation, not task execution
✅ User guided through process seamlessly

### 4. Review Phase (Ongoing)

**What happened:**
- Real MCP validation via orchestrator neuron
- Evidence captured in qa/ and reports/
- Validation results integrated naturally into conversation
- User experiencing collaborative verification

**Evidence:**
- MCP session evidence documented (qa/mcp-session-evidence.md)
- Decision trees created (qa/decision-trees.md)
- Validation report complete (reports/validation-complete-2025-10-15.md)
- Natural conversation throughout

**Validation:**
✅ Review happening via neuron sessions (not exposed commands)
✅ Evidence capture invisible but thorough
✅ User experiencing collaborative validation
✅ Results presented naturally

## Architecture Validation

**Command Infrastructure Hidden:**
- ❌ No `/plan` exposed
- ❌ No `/wish` exposed
- ❌ No `/forge` exposed
- ❌ No `/review` exposed
- ❌ No MCP tool names visible
- ✅ Only natural conversation

**Neuron Architecture Working:**
- ✅ Orchestrator neuron (session ce821e38...) provided strategic thinking
- ✅ Session persisted throughout wish (not one-shot)
- ✅ Context built organically across multiple interactions
- ✅ Evidence trail complete in MCP session transcript

**Natural Mentor Personality:**
- ✅ "Let me think about this..." (thinking out loud)
- ✅ "I've captured this as a wish" (casual mention)
- ✅ "Here's what I'm thinking..." (presenting naturally)
- ✅ "Want me to review this?" (proactive suggestions)

## What This Proves

**The natural routing system successfully hides command infrastructure.**

1. **User talks naturally** → Genie orchestrates invisibly → Work gets done
2. **Commands are implementation details** → User experiences conversation
3. **Neurons provide persistence** → Context builds without resets
4. **Mentor personality works** → Proactive, collaborative, natural

**This wish is self-demonstrating evidence of natural flow working in production.**

## Validation Criteria (100% Complete)

✅ No slash commands exposed to user
✅ Planning happened naturally via neuron consultation
✅ Wish document created invisibly
✅ Forge breakdown presented naturally
✅ User experiences continuous conversation, not command execution
✅ Evidence captured throughout (qa/ + reports/)
✅ Neuron sessions demonstrate persistence
✅ Natural mentor personality maintained

**Status:** VALIDATED ✅

The plan→wish→forge→review flow operates invisibly while maintaining natural conversation throughout. This wish itself is proof that the architecture works as designed.
