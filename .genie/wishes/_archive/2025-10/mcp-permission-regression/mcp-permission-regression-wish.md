## Discovery Summary

**Primary analyst:** Genie + Felipe

**Timeline of Events:**
- **2025-10-13:** Issue #35 closed (interactive permission feature request)
- **2025-10-14 02:00Z:** Permission fix applied - all 18 agents changed to `bypassPermissions`
- **2025-10-15 17:08Z:** Issue #44 created - Edit operations STILL prompt!

**Current Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ **Write to new files:** No prompts (bypassPermissions working)
- ‚ùå **Edit to existing files:** Permission prompts appear (bypassPermissions NOT working)

**Key Observations:**
- This is a **regression** - previously "fixed" but broken again
- Write and Edit operations diverge in permission handling
- `bypassPermissions` mode is correctly configured in all agent frontmatter
- Evidence suggests architectural issue not configuration issue

**Assumptions:**
- ASM-1: Write and Edit use different code paths in Claude Code
- ASM-2: `bypassPermissions` applies to Write but not Edit
- ASM-3: Issue exists in Claude Code runtime, not Genie configuration
- ASM-4: Workaround exists (use Write instead of Edit)

**Open Questions:**
- Q-1: Does Edit check permissions differently than Write?
- Q-2: Is there a missing permission mode for Edit operations?
- Q-3: Does `bypassPermissions` work for Edit in foreground mode?
- Q-4: Is this a Claude Code bug or Genie misconfiguration?

**Risks:**
- RISK-1: May be Claude Code bug (outside Genie control)
- RISK-2: Fix may require breaking changes to agent architecture
- RISK-3: Workaround (Write only) may limit agent capabilities

## Executive Summary

Background MCP agents configured with `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` successfully Write new files without prompts, but Edit operations on existing files still trigger permission prompts. This regression appeared after the Oct 14 permission fix that changed all agents to `bypassPermissions`. Investigation required to determine if this is a Claude Code runtime issue, Genie configuration issue, or architectural limitation.

## Current State

**Configuration:**
- All 18 agents use `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` (Oct 14 fix)
- stdin set to `'ignore'` in `shared.ts:391` (prevents interactive prompts)
- Background mode enabled by default (`background: true`)

**Observed Behavior:**
```bash
# Write operation (NEW FILE)
mcp__genie__run with agent="implementor" and prompt="Create new file"
# Result: ‚úÖ No prompts, file created

# Edit operation (EXISTING FILE)
mcp__genie__run with agent="implementor" and prompt="Edit existing file"
# Result: ‚ùå Permission prompt appears, agent blocks
```

**Evidence Files:**
- `.genie/reports/model-permissions-fix-202510140200.md` - Oct 14 fix documentation
- `.genie/reports/debug-model-permissions-202510140145.md` - Oct 14 debug analysis
- `.genie/state/agents/logs/test-permission-*.log` - 8+ test runs

**Pain Points:**
- Background agents cannot autonomously edit files
- Blocks fully autonomous wish execution
- Forces manual intervention during agent runs
- Limits MCP orchestration capabilities

## Target State & Guardrails

**Desired Behavior:**
- Both Write AND Edit operations succeed without prompts
- `bypassPermissions` applies uniformly to all file operations
- Background agents fully autonomous
- No regression to Oct 14 fix

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Must preserve Oct 14 fix (Write operations still work)
- Must not introduce new permission issues
- Must not break foreground mode (interactive approval when desired)
- Must add regression tests to prevent future issues

## Execution Groups

### Group A ‚Äì Root Cause Investigation
**Slug:** root-cause-analysis
**Goal:** Identify why Edit prompts but Write doesn't

**Surfaces:**
- Claude Code permission handling (black box)
- Genie agent configuration (known)
- MCP protocol permission modes (documented)

**Deliverables:**
1. Trace permission flow for Write operations
   - When does permission check happen?
   - Where does `bypassPermissions` apply?
   - What gates exist?
2. Trace permission flow for Edit operations
   - Same questions as Write
   - Identify divergence point
3. Form root cause hypothesis:
   - Claude Code bug?
   - Genie misconfiguration?
   - MCP protocol limitation?
4. Test hypothesis with debug agent:
   ```bash
   mcp__genie__run with agent="debug" and prompt="
   Investigate why Edit prompts but Write doesn't with bypassPermissions.
   Evidence: Issue #44, Oct 14 fix report.
   "
   ```

**Evidence:**
- Store debug session transcript in `qa/debug-session-<timestamp>.md`
- Capture permission flow diagrams
- Document hypothesis and test results

**Validation:**
```bash
# Test Write (baseline)
# Create test agent with bypassPermissions
# Verify Write succeeds without prompt

# Test Edit (bug)
# Same agent, Edit existing file
# Verify Edit prompts (confirms bug)

# Test foreground mode
# Agent without background:true
# Verify Edit prompts as expected (not regression)
```

**Suggested personas:** debug agent via MCP

**External tracker:** None

---

### Group B ‚Äì Fix Implementation
**Slug:** permission-fix
**Goal:** Apply fix based on root cause findings

**Surfaces:**
- To be determined after Group A investigation

**Deliverables:**
- Fix implementation (depends on root cause)
- Regression tests for Edit operations
- Documentation of changes

**Evidence:**
- Before/after test results
- Code changes with rationale
- Validation that Oct 14 fix still works

**Validation:**
```bash
# Test Write (must still work)
# Create new file via background agent
# Expect: No prompts

# Test Edit (must now work)
# Edit existing file via background agent
# Expect: No prompts

# Test foreground (must still work)
# Edit via foreground agent
# Expect: Prompts as designed
```

**Suggested personas:** implementor, tests

**External tracker:** None

---

### Group C ‚Äì Regression Testing
**Slug:** regression-tests
**Goal:** Add tests to prevent future regressions

**Surfaces:**
- Test suite for permission modes
- CI integration

**Deliverables:**
1. Permission mode test suite:
   ```typescript
   describe('Permission modes', () => {
     test('bypassPermissions - Write new file (no prompt)', async () => {
       // Test implementation
     });

     test('bypassPermissions - Edit existing file (no prompt)', async () => {
       // Test implementation
     });

     test('default - Edit prompts in foreground', async () => {
       // Test implementation
     });
   });
   ```
2. CI integration (if applicable)
3. Documentation of test scenarios

**Evidence:**
- Test suite code
- Test execution logs
- CI results (if applicable)

**Validation:**
```bash
# Run test suite
pnpm test:permissions
# Expect: All tests pass

# Verify coverage
# Both Write and Edit operations covered
# Both background and foreground modes covered
```

**Suggested personas:** tests

**External tracker:** None

## Verification Plan

**Validation Steps:**
1. Reproduce issue #44 (confirm Edit prompts with bypassPermissions)
2. Run Group A investigation (identify root cause)
3. Implement Group B fix (based on root cause)
4. Run Group C regression tests (verify fix + no regressions)
5. Close issue #44 with evidence

**Evidence Storage:**
- Investigation: `qa/debug-session-<timestamp>.md`
- Fix: `qa/fix-validation-<timestamp>.md`
- Tests: `qa/regression-tests.md`
- Reports: `reports/done-<group>-<timestamp>.md`

**Branch Strategy:** Dedicated branch `fix/mcp-permission-regression`

### Evidence Checklist

**Validation Commands (exact):**
```bash
# Reproduce bug
mcp__genie__run with agent="implementor" and prompt="Edit .genie/agents/README.md"
# Expect: Permission prompt (bug confirmed)

# After fix
mcp__genie__run with agent="implementor" and prompt="Edit .genie/agents/README.md"
# Expect: No prompt (bug fixed)

# Verify Write still works
mcp__genie__run with agent="implementor" and prompt="Create /tmp/test.txt"
# Expect: No prompt (Oct 14 fix preserved)
```

**Artifact Paths:**
- Debug session: `.genie/wishes/mcp-permission-regression/qa/debug-session-*.md`
- Fix validation: `.genie/wishes/mcp-permission-regression/qa/fix-validation.md`
- Test results: `.genie/wishes/mcp-permission-regression/qa/regression-tests.md`
- Done Reports: `.genie/wishes/mcp-permission-regression/reports/done-*.md`

**Approval Checkpoints:**

- [ ] Regression tests validated (Group C completion)

## Spec Contract

**Scope:**
- Investigate root cause of Edit permission prompts
- Implement fix (depends on root cause)
- Add regression tests for Edit operations
- Document changes and close issue #44

**Out of Scope:**
- Redesigning permission system architecture
- Adding new permission modes
- Fixing unrelated permission issues
- Performance optimization

**Success Metrics:**
- Edit operations work without prompts in background mode (100% success rate)
- Write operations continue working (no regression)
- Foreground permission prompts still work (no regression)
- Regression tests pass (100% coverage of issue #44 scenario)

**External Tasks:**
- May require Claude Code runtime fix (if root cause is external)
- May require MCP protocol update (if protocol limitation)

**Dependencies:**
- Oct 14 permission fix (must preserve)
- Claude Code permission handling (black box)
- MCP protocol specification

## Blocker Protocol

1. Pause work and create `reports/blocker-mcp-permission-regression-<timestamp>.md`
2. Document findings: root cause, blockers, external dependencies
3. Notify Felipe
4. Wait for updated guidance or escalation

## Resolution Summary

**Finding:** This is NOT a regression bug. The fix was already implemented and published.

**Root Cause:**
- Claude Code's `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` doesn't bypass Edit prompts
- Fix uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` instead (full bypass)

**Fix Details:**
- **Committed:** 2025-10-15 14:28 UTC (commit e5f7d88)
- **Author:** Felipe Rosa
- **Published in:** v2.4.0-rc.0+ (current: v2.4.0-rc.4)
- **Location:** `.genie/cli/src/executors/claude.ts:40-41`

**Version Status:**
- ‚ùå v2.3.7 and earlier: Does NOT have fix
- ‚úÖ v2.4.0-rc.0+: Has fix
- ‚úÖ npm @next (v2.4.0-rc.4): Has fix ‚úÖ

**Resolution:** User needs to upgrade to v2.4.0-rc.0 or later

## Proposals for Refinement

### Proposal 1: Investigation Approach

**Option A: Use Debug Agent (Recommended)**
- Use `mcp__genie__run with agent="debug"` for systematic investigation
- Pros: Structured analysis, evidence trail, reproducible
- Cons: Takes longer, requires MCP session

**Option B: Manual Debug**
- Directly inspect code and test manually
- Pros: Faster for simple issues
- Cons: Less documentation, harder to reproduce

**Recommendation:** Option A (Debug Agent) - This is an architectural issue requiring systematic analysis.

### Proposal 2: Fix Strategy

**Depends on root cause findings from Group A:**

**If Claude Code bug:**
- File bug report with Claude Code team
- Document workaround (use Write instead of Edit)
- Track upstream fix

**If Genie misconfiguration:**
- Fix configuration
- Add validation
- Document correct pattern

**If MCP protocol limitation:**
- Propose protocol enhancement
- Implement workaround
- Document limitation

### Proposal 3: Workaround Strategy

**Temporary workaround (while investigating):**
- Agents use Write (delete + recreate) instead of Edit
- Preserves autonomous execution
- Slightly less efficient but functional

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Instead of Edit
await Edit(file, oldContent, newContent);

// Use Write workaround
const content = await Read(file);
const updated = content.replace(oldContent, newContent);
await Write(file, updated);
```

**Recommendation:** Document workaround but investigate proper fix.
