# Run vs Task Comparison

## Interactive run (`node dist/cli/genie.js run browser-test`)
- Opens Forge browser automatically (see browser-test.log for xdg-open + monitoring banner)
- Waits until Forge WebSocket reports completion (run timed out after ~300s because executor never finished, proving monitor loop held the CLI open)
- Emits JSON summary once execution completes (or timeout block prints status)

## Headless task (`node dist/cli/genie.js task browser-test --quiet`)
- Returns immediately with structured JSON (see json-output-sample.json)
- No browser launch, intended for automation/scripting

This log captures the behavioral contract difference: `run` is interactive + blocking, `task` is automation-friendly fire-and-forget.
