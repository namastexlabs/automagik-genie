# Done Report: Task A - Git Patterns Extraction
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-17 18:53 UTC
**Task:** Extract GitHub workflow patterns from AGENTS.md → git.md
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Working Tasks

- [x] Read AGENTS.md lines 41-179 (GitHub patterns)
- [x] Append to git.md with "Developer Welcome Flow" section
- [x] Replace in AGENTS.md with @ reference
- [x] Run validation commands
- [x] Create Done Report

---

## Completed Work

**Files modified:**
1. `.genie/agents/genie/neurons/git/git.md` - Appended GitHub patterns (198→340 lines, +142 lines)
2. `AGENTS.md` - Replaced with @ reference (2272→2138 lines, -134 lines)

**Content extracted:**
- Developer Welcome Flow (lines 41-72)
- Quick Capture Workflow (lines 74-94)
- Git & GitHub Workflow Integration (lines 96-179)

**@ Reference added:**
```markdown
## GitHub Workflow Patterns

For developer welcome flow, quick capture workflow, and complete GitHub integration patterns, see:

**@.genie/agents/code/neurons/git/git.md** (GitHub workflow patterns section)
```

## Evidence Location

**Pattern Preservation:**
```bash
# Developer Welcome Flow
grep -q "Developer Welcome Flow" .genie/agents/genie/neurons/git/git.md
# ✅ PASS

# Quick Capture
grep -q "Quick Capture Workflow" .genie/agents/genie/neurons/git/git.md
# ✅ PASS

# Template rules
grep -q "Template selection rules" .genie/agents/genie/neurons/git/git.md
# ✅ PASS
```

**AGENTS.md Update:**
```bash
# @ reference added
grep -q "@.genie/agents/code/neurons/git/git.md" AGENTS.md
# ✅ PASS

# Old content removed
! grep -q "Developer Welcome Flow" AGENTS.md
# ✅ PASS
```

**Line Count Reduction:**
```bash
wc -l AGENTS.md
# Result: 2138 lines
# Expected: ~2134 lines (138 line reduction)
# Actual: 134 line reduction (close match)
```

## Deferred/Blocked Items

None - Task A completed successfully via direct execution (MCP bugs prevented implementor delegation).

## Risks & Follow-ups

**Risks:**
- None identified

**Follow-ups:**
- **Task B:** Extract prompting standards (lines 1001-1115, 1769-1882) → prompt.md
- **Task C:** Extract forge patterns (lines 1209-1258) → forge.md
- **Task D:** Extract learn patterns (lines 1260-1279) → learn.md
- **Task E:** Extract release protocol (lines 1361-1402) → release.md
- **Task F:** Create supporting docs (4 files in .genie/docs/)
- **Task G:** Absorb .genie/custom/ content
- **Task H:** Final validation (≤500 lines target)

**Next Steps:**
- Decision needed: Continue with Tasks B-H directly, or wait for MCP fixes?
- Current approach (direct execution) working for context optimization priority
- MCP fixes in progress (per Felipe's note)

## Summary

✅ Task A complete with zero knowledge loss
✅ 134 lines removed from AGENTS.md (6% reduction toward ≤500 line target)
✅ All GitHub workflow patterns preserved in git.md with @ reference
✅ Validation commands pass
✅ Ready for Task B or await MCP fixes per Felipe's decision
