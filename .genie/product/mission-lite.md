# Product Mission (Lite)

{{PROJECT_NAME}} is a template-first agent framework that installs into any repository to orchestrate planning, wishing, forging, review, and commit workflows with full evidence capture. Replace project-specific content with placeholders.

It serves developers and teams who need consistent workflows, trackable decisions, and quality assurance across {{DOMAIN}} projects. The framework provides agent orchestration, specialist templates, and built-in evaluation to maintain high standards.
