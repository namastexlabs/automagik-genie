# Prompting Standards

**Core principles:**
- Use Discovery → Implementation → Verification sections in agents and prompts.
- Always reference files with `@` to auto-load content.
- Define success/failure boundaries explicitly.
- Encourage concrete examples/snippets over abstractions.
- Advanced prompting guidance lives in `@.genie/agents/neurons/prompt.md`.
