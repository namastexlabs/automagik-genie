# GitHub Actions Workflow Failures Investigation Report

## 🚨 Executive Summary

The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is failing due to **two critical issues**:

1. **Publish Workflow Failure**: `jest: not found` error - dependencies not installed before running tests
2. **Validation Workflow Failure**: 3 failing tests in the `init-with-backup.test.js` suite due to naming convention changes

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Publish Workflow (`publish.yml`) - CRITICAL

**Root Cause**: The publish workflow is missing the `npm install` step before running tests.

**Error Details**:
```bash
publish	Run tests	2025-08-05T18:56:51.2845940Z sh: 1: jest: not found
publish	Run tests	2025-08-05T18:56:51.2929920Z ##[error]Process completed with exit code 127.
```

**Flow Analysis**:
1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Setup Node.js 18
3. ✅ Extract version from tag (1.2.3)
4. ✅ Verify package.json version matches tag
5. ✅ Validate version sequence
6. ✅ Verify package contents
7. ❌ **Run tests** - FAILS because jest is not installed (no `npm install` step)
8. 🚫 Publish to NPM - Never reached

**Impact**: This prevents any package from being published to NPM, blocking releases entirely.

### Issue 2: Validation Workflow (`validate.yml`) - HIGH PRIORITY

**Root Cause**: Tests are failing due to recent changes in agent naming conventions. The backup integration tests expect old naming patterns that no longer match the current implementation.

**Failing Tests**:
1. `should integrate backup information into new CLAUDE.md`
2. `should handle initialization without backup directories` 
3. `should handle corrupt backup files gracefully`

**Specific Errors**:

#### Test 1: Agent File Naming Mismatch
```javascript
// Expected (old pattern):
expect(agentFiles).toContain('test-backup-project-analyzer.md');

// Actual (new pattern):
["test-backup-project-genie-analyzer.md", "test-backup-project-genie-agent-creator.md", ...]
```

#### Test 2 & 3: Missing "Getting Started" Section
```javascript
// Expected content not found in generated CLAUDE.md:
expect(claudeMdContent).toContain('Getting Started');
```

**Analysis**: The template generation logic has been updated but the tests haven't been synchronized with these changes.

## 🛠️ Specific Fixes Required

### Fix 1: Publish Workflow - Add Dependencies Installation

**File**: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
**Location**: After "Setup Node.js" step, before "Verify package contents"

**Required Change**:
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'

# ADD THIS STEP:
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install

- name: Verify package contents
  run: |
    echo "=== Package.json ==="
    cat package.json | grep -A5 -B5 version
    echo "=== Files to be published ==="
    npm pack --dry-run
```

### Fix 2: Update Test Expectations

**File**: `tests/init-with-backup.test.js`

**Changes Required**:

1. **Update agent file expectations** (Line 88-90):
```javascript
// Change from:
expect(agentFiles).toContain('test-backup-project-analyzer.md');
expect(agentFiles).toContain('test-backup-project-dev-coder.md');
expect(agentFiles).toContain('test-backup-project-dev-planner.md');

// Change to:
expect(agentFiles).toContain('test-backup-project-genie-analyzer.md');
expect(agentFiles).toContain('test-backup-project-genie-dev-coder.md');
expect(agentFiles).toContain('test-backup-project-genie-dev-planner.md');
```

2. **Update content expectations** (Lines 124, 154):
```javascript
// These tests expect "Getting Started" which is no longer in the template
// Need to check what content is actually generated and update expectations
```

## 📋 Implementation Priority

### Priority 1 - CRITICAL (Blocks all releases):
1. Fix publish workflow by adding `npm install` step

### Priority 2 - HIGH (Blocks PR merges):
2. Fix failing backup integration tests

## 🔄 Workflow Impact Analysis

### Current State:
- ❌ **Releases blocked**: Cannot publish to NPM
- ❌ **PR validation failing**: 3 test failures
- ❌ **Continuous integration broken**: Manual intervention required

### After Fixes:
- ✅ **Releases restored**: NPM publishing will work
- ✅ **PR validation working**: All tests passing
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline healthy**: Automated workflow restored

## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### For Publish Workflow:
1. Create a test release to verify the fix works
2. Ensure all version validation logic still functions
3. Verify NPM publishing succeeds

### For Validation Workflow:
1. Run tests locally after fixes
2. Verify all test suites pass
3. Test with both Node 18 and Node 20 matrices

## 📝 Evidence Files

### Workflow Files:
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` - Missing npm install
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` - Working but tests failing

### Test Files:
- `tests/init-with-backup.test.js` - 3 failing tests
- `tests/smoke.test.js` - ✅ Passing
- `tests/update-system.test.js` - ✅ Passing  
- `tests/mcp-config.test.js` - ✅ Passing
- `tests/backup-analysis.test.js` - ✅ Passing

### Recent Commits Contributing to Issues:
- `4e323d2` - chore: bump patch version to 1.2.3
- `94a7045` - fix: make CLAUDE.md creation more clean and project focused
- `708689f` - feat: genie init now considers the old CLAUDE.md to maintain consistency

The agent naming convention changes and template updates occurred in recent commits but tests weren't updated accordingly.

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix the publish workflow to unblock releases
2. **Short-term**: Update failing tests to match current implementation
3. **Long-term**: Add integration tests to catch workflow/test mismatches earlier

This investigation provides a complete roadmap for restoring the CI/CD pipeline functionality.
