# Claude Code Hook Investigation - CRITICAL FINDINGS

## üö® HOOK SYSTEM STATUS: PARTIALLY BROKEN

### Evidence Summary

**‚úÖ WORKING COMPONENTS:**
- Hook scripts are executable and function correctly when called manually
- TDD validator logic works perfectly: `echo '{"tool": "Write", "tool_input": {"file_path": "lib/new_feature.js", "content": "..."}}' | node ./.claude/tdd_validator.js` correctly blocks implementation files
- Settings.json syntax is valid and follows documented patterns
- File permissions are correct (all scripts executable)

**‚ùå BROKEN/MISSING COMPONENTS:**
- Hooks are NOT executing during actual Write/Edit/MultiEdit operations
- No hook output during real file operations (confirmed by creating test files)
- Hook registration status unknown - cannot verify if hooks are loaded

### Key Documentation Findings

From `/disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery`:

1. **Hook Discovery Command**: `/hooks` command should show registered hooks
2. **Debug Mode**: `claude --debug` should show hook execution details
3. **Settings Location**: Multiple settings files possible (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, etc.)

### Investigation Results

**Manual Hook Testing:**
```bash
# TDD validator works perfectly:
echo '{"tool": "Write", "tool_input": {"file_path": "lib/new_feature.js", "content": "function newFeature() { return true; }"}}' | node ./.claude/tdd_validator.js
# Output: ‚ùå RED PHASE VIOLATION: Creating implementation file 'lib/new_feature.js' without corresponding tests. Create tests first!

# But actual Write operations bypass hooks completely:
Write(file_path="hook_trigger_test.js", content="console.log('test');")
# Result: File created with NO hook execution
```

**Environment Analysis:**
- Claude Code version: Available at `/home/cezar/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/claude`
- Multiple Claude processes running (suggests active usage)
- Environment: `CLAUDECODE=1`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=0`

### Possible Root Causes

1. **Hook Registration Failure**: Hooks may not be loading/registering properly
2. **Settings Location Issue**: May need global settings file (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
3. **Claude Code Version Limitation**: This deployment may not support hooks
4. **Permission/Environment Restrictions**: WSL2 or permission limitations
5. **Configuration Schema Issue**: May need different JSON structure

### Next Investigation Steps

1. **Test Hook Discovery**: Try `/hooks` command to check registration
2. **Debug Mode**: Use `claude --debug` to monitor hook execution
3. **Global Settings**: Test with `~/.claude/settings.json`
4. **Alternative Configurations**: Try different JSON structures from docs
5. **Version Compatibility**: Research if this Claude Code version supports hooks

### Critical Business Impact

**TDD SYSTEM COMPROMISED**: Without working hooks, TDD Guard cannot enforce Red-Green-Refactor cycles, allowing:
- Implementation files created without tests (RED PHASE VIOLATIONS)
- Potential technical debt accumulation
- Loss of development discipline

### Recommended Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement alternative TDD validation in agent workflows
2. **SHORT-TERM**: Continue hook investigation with expanded testing
3. **FALLBACK**: Create pre-commit style validation hooks if Claude Code hooks remain broken
