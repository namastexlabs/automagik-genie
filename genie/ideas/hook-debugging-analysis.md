# TDD Hook System Debugging Analysis

## Problem Statement
Claude Code hooks are correctly configured but not executing during Write/Edit/MultiEdit operations despite:
- ✅ Correct `.claude/settings.json` configuration 
- ✅ Executable hook scripts that work manually
- ✅ Working TDD validator logic when invoked directly
- ❌ Complete bypass during actual Write tool operations

## Investigation Strategy

### Phase 1: Environment & Version Analysis
1. Check Claude Code version and deployment type
2. Verify environment permissions and restrictions
3. Investigate hook system compatibility
4. Test hook execution contexts

### Phase 2: Configuration Deep Dive  
1. Validate settings.json schema requirements
2. Test alternative hook configurations
3. Check for conflicting settings
4. Verify hook script permissions and paths

### Phase 3: Behavioral Testing
1. Test hooks with different file operations
2. Monitor system calls during Write operations
3. Check for silent failures or error suppression
4. Test in different directory contexts

### Phase 4: Workaround Development
1. If hooks fundamentally broken, develop alternative TDD enforcement
2. Create pre-commit style validation
3. Implement tool-level TDD checking
4. Design backup validation strategies

## Evidence Collection Plan
- System information gathering
- Hook execution monitoring  
- File system permission analysis
- Claude Code configuration investigation
- Alternative validation mechanism testing
