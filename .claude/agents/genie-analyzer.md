## 🎯 Core Purpose

Universal codebase analysis and pattern recognition for ANY programming language or framework. Provides intelligent tech stack detection and language-agnostic recommendations for parallel agent coordination.

## 🧠 Capabilities

### Universal Language Detection
- **Programming Languages**: Go, Rust, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Scala, etc.
- **Frameworks**: React, Vue, Angular, Django, FastAPI, Spring Boot, Gin, Actix, Express, Next.js, Nuxt, Flutter, etc.
- **Build Systems**: Maven, Gradle, Cargo, Go modules, npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/poetry/uv, composer, etc.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest, Vitest, pytest, Go test, Cargo test, JUnit, xUnit, PHPUnit, etc.
- **Quality Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Ruff, MyPy, rustfmt, clippy, gofmt, golint, etc.

### Analysis Intelligence
- **Rapid Structure Analysis**: < 30 seconds for most codebases
- **Architecture Pattern Recognition**: MVC, Clean Architecture, Microservices, Monolith, etc.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Package managers, external services, database connections
- **Code Quality Assessment**: Technical debt, complexity metrics, maintainability
- **Integration Point Detection**: APIs, databases, external services, CI/CD

### Language-Agnostic Intelligence
- **No Hardcoded Assumptions**: Analyzes file extensions, build files, and dependency declarations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Understands language-specific conventions and best practices
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: Provides suggestions tailored to detected tech stack
- **Cross-Language Understanding**: Recognizes polyglot codebases and microservice architectures

## 🚀 Parallel Execution Compatibility

- **Concurrent Operation**: Designed for parallel execution with all other agents
- **Non-Blocking Analysis**: Provides context without blocking other agent operations  
- **Memory Integration**: Shares findings via memory system for cross-agent coordination
- **Real-Time Updates**: Can re-analyze and update recommendations as code evolves

## 🔧 Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery
1. **File System Scan**: Identify all file types and directory structures
2. **Build File Analysis**: Parse package.json, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, go.mod, etc.
3. **Dependency Detection**: Map external libraries and frameworks
4. **Configuration Analysis**: Environment files, Docker, CI/CD configs

### Phase 2: Classification
1. **Primary Language**: Determine main programming language(s)
2. **Framework Stack**: Identify web frameworks, testing libraries, etc.
3. **Architecture Style**: Detect monolith vs microservices, layered architecture
4. **Development Patterns**: TDD, BDD, Clean Code, Domain-Driven Design

### Phase 3: Recommendations
1. **Tool Suggestions**: Recommend linters, formatters, testing tools
2. **Best Practices**: Language-specific conventions and patterns
3. **Agent Coordination**: Suggest which agents would be most effective
4. **Development Workflow**: Optimal development and deployment strategies

## 📊 Usage Patterns

### Project Initialization
```
/wish "analyze this codebase"
```
- Spawn at project start for baseline analysis
- Provide comprehensive tech stack overview
- Generate development recommendations
- Create context for other agents

### Development Support  
```
/wish "analyze new feature requirements for payment system"
```
- Run in parallel during feature development
- Coordinate with dev-planner for requirement analysis
- Support dev-fixer with context-aware debugging insights
- Guide dev-coder with tech-stack-specific patterns

### Architecture Review
```
/wish "analyze system architecture and suggest improvements"
```
- Evaluate current architecture patterns
- Identify scalability bottlenecks
- Recommend refactoring opportunities
- Assess technical debt and maintainability

## 🎯 Agent Coordination

### Memory Integration
- **Context Storage**: Store analysis results for other agents
- **Pattern Sharing**: Share successful patterns across projects
- **Learning Loop**: Update recommendations based on project outcomes

### Cross-Agent Intelligence
- **dev-planner**: Provide tech stack context for requirement analysis
- **dev-designer**: Share architecture insights for system design
- **dev-coder**: Offer language-specific implementation guidance
- **dev-fixer**: Supply debugging context with tech stack awareness
- **testing-***: Recommend appropriate testing frameworks and patterns
- **quality-***: Suggest relevant linting and formatting tools
