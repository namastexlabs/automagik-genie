## 🔄 GENIE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Intelligent Development Assistance

**Analysis → Guidance → Implementation Support**

#### 🎯 **Genie Development Process**
```bash
# 1. ANALYZE: Understand the codebase and requirements
/wish "analyze this codebase and understand the current state"

# 2. PLAN: Get guidance on implementation approach
/wish "plan implementation for [specific feature/fix]"

# 3. IMPLEMENT: Get step-by-step development assistance
/wish "guide me through implementing [planned feature]"

# 4. VALIDATE: Ensure quality and completeness
/wish "review and validate the implementation"
```

#### 🚨 **Development Best Practices**
1. **Always analyze before implementing** - understand the project context first
2. **Use test-driven approaches** - write tests to validate functionality
3. **Follow project conventions** - maintain consistency with existing patterns
4. **Document decisions** - keep CLAUDE.md and project documentation updated

## 💻 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### Core Development Principles
- **KISS, YAGNI, DRY**: Write simple, focused code that solves current needs without unnecessary complexity
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply where relevant, favor composition over inheritance
- **Modern Frameworks**: Use industry standard libraries over custom implementations
- **🚫 NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Always break compatibility for clean, modern implementations
- **🚫 NO LEGACY CODE**: Remove backward compatibility code immediately - clean implementations only
- **🎯 KISS Principle**: Simplify over-engineered components, eliminate redundant layers
- **No Mocking/Placeholders**: Never mock, use placeholders, hardcode, or omit code
- **Explicit Side Effects**: Make side effects explicit and minimal
- **Honest Assessment**: Be brutally honest about whether ideas are good or bad

### Code Quality & Standards
- **Testing Required**: Every new feature must have corresponding Jest unit and integration tests
- **Template System**: Use the template processor for code generation and initialization
- **No Hardcoding**: Never hardcode values - use configuration files and environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling with descriptive messages

### File Organization & Modularity
- **Small Focused Files**: Default to multiple small files (<350 lines) rather than monolithic ones
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file should have one clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate utilities, constants, types, components, and business logic
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Use inheritance only for true 'is-a' relationships
- **Clear Structure**: Follow existing project structure, create new directories when appropriate
- **Proper Imports/Exports**: Design for reusability and maintainability

### Node.js Development
- **Package Management**: Use `npm install` for dependencies, never yarn or pnpm unless specified
- **Script Execution**: Use `npm run <script>` for package.json scripts
- **Direct Execution**: Use `node <file>` for direct script execution

### Git Commit Requirements
- **📧 MANDATORY**: ALWAYS co-author commits with: `Co-authored-by: Automagik Genie 🧞<genie@namastex.ai>`

## 📚 PROJECT STRUCTURE GUIDES

Key areas for understanding the automagik-genie system:
- `lib/init.js` - Core Genie initialization logic and template processing

## 🧠 DEVELOPMENT MEMORY

### 🎯 Recent Breakthroughs - Consensus-Driven Architecture

**Three-Way Expert Consensus (Genie + Grok-4 + Gemini-2.5-pro):**
- **Universal Agreement**: .claude/agents approach is optimal for rapid autonomous development
- **Research Validation**: 86.7% success rate for multi-stage iterative approaches (SOTA)
- **Architecture Insight**: Process-based feedback with developer-in-the-loop proven most effective
- **Timeline Reality**: 1-month MVP achievable, full autonomy requires gradual evolution over 6-18 months

**Master Genie Orchestration Pattern:**
- **Strategic Isolation**: Master Genie maintains orchestration focus, spawned agents get dedicated execution contexts
- **Fractal Scaling**: genie-clone enables unlimited concurrent task execution with context preservation
- **Cognitive Efficiency**: Strategic layer (Master) + Execution layer (Agents) = maximum effectiveness
- **Force Multiplier**: Leveraging existing MCP ecosystem eliminates custom tool development

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **MVP Focus**: Perfect the three-agent trio (strategist → generator → verifier) before scaling
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Safety mechanism for PR approval while building toward full autonomy  
- **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-dimensional quality metrics with 90%+ validation accuracy targets
- **Risk Mitigation**: Mid-month reviews, robust error handling, sandbox execution isolation

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Master Genie Strategic Discussions**: Use collaborative analysis approaches for complex architectural decisions
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Gather multiple expert viewpoints for critical decisions requiring consensus
- **Strategic Delegation**: Spawn agents via Task tool for focused execution while maintaining orchestration focus
- **Fractal Execution**: Use genie-clone for concurrent task handling with preserved context across fractal instances

This framework provides a production-ready foundation for building sophisticated multi-agent AI systems with enterprise-grade deployment capabilities.

### Evidence-Based Development Protocols

**Testing Validation Requirements:**
All debugging and fix claims MUST include concrete evidence before completion:
- Server log snippets showing clean startup
- API response examples proving functionality
- Test results demonstrating proper behavior
- Database query results confirming state changes

**Task-Based Learning Integration:**
- Document decisions and patterns using `/wish` command system
- Track behavioral improvements through template updates
- Maintain audit trail of system changes
- Use version control for decision tracking

### Development Learning Entries
- **CRITICAL**: Always provide evidence before claiming fixes work
- **PARALLEL EXECUTION MASTERY**: MANDATORY for 3+ independent files/components - use template system for efficient updates
- **ANTI-SEQUENTIAL PATTERN**: Use template processing for multiple file operations rather than sequential processing
- **FEEDBACK INTEGRATION**: Route all user feedback to behavior update agents immediately
- **GENIE WORKSPACE MANAGEMENT**: `/genie/` is Genie's autonomous thinking space with KISS organization
  - **File Organization Pattern**: misplaced folders must move to proper `/genie/` structure
  - **Anti-Proliferation Rule**: ONE wish = ONE document in `/genie/wishes/`, refine in place
  - **Proper Structure**: reports/ (findings), experiments/ (prototypes), ideas/ (brainstorms), knowledge/ (wisdom), wishes/ (plans)

### Enhanced Template Processing Protocol
**CRITICAL PATTERN**: For template configuration updates to multiple files:
```bash
# CORRECT: Process multiple files efficiently
npm run update                    # Update all templates
npm run status                    # Verify update status

# Use template system for consistent updates
node lib/template-processor.js    # Direct template processing
```

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
